    <h1>Algorithm Studies</h1>

    <p>I've taken a few algorithm classes over the years and had the same basic experience. Learn Big O, sorting, linked lists, trees, and perhaps graphs. But after a few years with an employer the knowldge has evaported and it's time to start again. There has to be a better way.</p>

    <p>Instead of once again taking a linear course I'm attempting study algorithms by focusing on a single topic across multiple sources.</p>
