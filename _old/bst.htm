            Or why I like to start in the midde. This is not my first run at data structures and algorithms. It's approximately my fourth and none of it has stuck. Why? Use and study. Compelling myself to write and cmmmit code solves the study and while I may never need a BST on the job I'd like the knowldge firmly set in my brain.

            I have for years been admonishing myself to start a tech blog and yet I haven't. The reasons are simple. I'm not much of a writer and there are many smart people all ready doing it better. Not to mention that what we don't need is more click-bait top 5 lists or explanations of concepts all ready well explained. These studies are instead an attempt to solve a set of problems I have while learning.

            And one other thing. I'm giving myself permission to do somthing I find personally frightening. Which is to look stupid publicly. Not only because it's a point of personal growth for myself but also because I sincerely hope that someone else may see the struggle and thereby have their imposter syndome eased somewhat. For that reasons I expect myself to publish both completed studies with final code and the initial notes with every do-over and misunderstanding.

        <h2>Problem 1: Easily Distracted</h2>

        <p>
            I like to learn. It may in fact be my favorite. Often while learning something I stumble across other interesing things and excitedly pursue those transitioning away from the original area of study. Writing forces me to make note of new interesting things and stay on target.

        <h2>Problem 2: Notes Everywhere</h2>

        <p>
            I have markdown files and notebooks and comments spread across more repositories than I care to admint. I need one place to come back to. Better than that I need a place where I can revise my knowldge based on the learning of new things.

        <h2>Problem 3: Picking up Where I Left Off</h2>

        <p>
            With notes everywhere and the natural distractions of life ever at work there are of course times when an area of study needs to be paused to pursue a more immediate goal. Being able to pick up where I left off rather than starting back at the beginning.

        <h2>Problem 4: I Don't Learn the Way I Used Too</h2>

        <p>
            Reading books and watching videos is great but I find it incredibly easy to partially or fully zone out. How I learn is how I work. By sitting down in front of an editor, RTFM and building something. Writing code and my understanding whether correct or incorrect is at present a better way for me to learn.
