      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>I have over the years intermittently agonized over starting a blog. They are (or perhaps were) good for building a personal profile. A lot of smart people have them. I could, I flatter myself, be among them.</p>

      <p>But in typical developer fashion I've spent a lot of time idly reviewing software and losing interest in the core goal before starting. I'd lose sleep over it but there are a lot of smart people doing it better.</p>
        
      <p>This is not a blog.</p>

      <p>This is instead an attempt to find a solution to a problem of my own. The problem of focused study, natural interruption, scattered notes and returning to an area of interest after time has passed.</p>

      <p>My site is instead a series of studies. Sometimes an exploration of some bit of code I didn't have the time to do a second experimental version of. Other times notes on something I'm learning. All subject to revision, expansion or correction as I learn. Lastly and most hopefully a way refocus myself on some important area when life has pulled me in some other direction.</p>

      <p>If you find yourself here than I hope my notes provide you with some helpful insight, knowledge or reference.</p>
