        <h2 id="anchor-foreward">Foreward</h2>

        <p>
          Due to a conflict between a vacation and the delivery of my pre-order of the 5th Edition Player&rsquo;s
          handbook I wound up at the Gamer&rsquo;s Gambit in Saddlebrook, NJ. My aim was simply to get a pre-release
          copy to read on vacation but I left with an invitation to play at the store.
        </p>
        <p>Thus began my second love affair with Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
        <p>
          I&rsquo;d unintentionally taken a long hiatus, of perhaps 15 years, from playing D&amp;D as a serious hobby
          and thought (rather naively) I could pick up where I had left off. The old muscles had atrophied from disuse
          however, but with the patience of new friends they slowly redeveloped.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the old skills returned so did the desire to tinker with the rules. For various reasons this can be more
          difficult in 5E. Out of frustration I began to look back at the D&amp;D of my youth and discover (admittedly
          late) the OSR.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time passed, the unspecified plague of unknown origin ended in-person play and dispersed friends, isolated in
          their homes, were looking for entertainment. A new group formed and in this environment the opportunity to
          experiment with different games emerged.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was here that I began to analyze TSR era D&amp;D and its retro-clones to find a system more satisfying to
          plan and to run. The analysis wasn&rsquo;t easy. I&rsquo;m strongly drawn to the simplicity of the various
          basic boxes of D&amp;D and to Old School Essentials. I have a large amount of nostalgia for 2E AD&amp;D. In
          the end I decided on AD&amp;D. Not because I think AD&amp;D is perfect. Not because I love seeing &ldquo;E.
          Gary Gygax&rdquo; on the covers of my books; which I do. But because I felt then, as I do now, that AD&amp;D
          is a strong foundation to build a game on.
        </p>
        <p>
          With one modern AD&amp;D game behind me and a lot of time to consider my next move I&rsquo;ve decided (because
          I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself) to follow in the footsteps of so many fools. This is the start of my quixotical
          quest for the &ldquo;Fantasy Heartbreaker.&rdquo; The perfect game that makes the DM and all of his players
          happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aim is a simplified game that&rsquo;s fun to play, that can be easily modified to suit each new campaign
          but that remains AD&amp;D at the core. I could go into a great deal of depth as to why but the very short
          reason is the ability to play a lot of wonderful adventures written for TSR era D&amp;D with little or no
          modification.
        </p>
        <p>
          All who participate in the game are encouraged to contribute to its evolution. I hope for this document to be
          the first step to a more fun, more customized game and I look forward to playing with all of you.
        </p>

        <h2 id="anchor-introduction">Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          The document you&rsquo;re reading now extends and supersedes the AD&amp;D Players Handbook. In some places it
          alters tables or simplifies or changes rules. In other places it moves rules from the AD&amp;D Dungeon
          Master&rsquo;s guide for the sake of clarity. Having the AD&amp;D Players Handbook available during play is
          helpful but not strictly necessary. The OSRIC Compendium may also be used.
        </p>

        <p>These rules may be revised at any time for consistency and clarity.</p>

            Roll 4d6 six times. Remove the lowest die from each roll. For Example, if &nbsp;a 6, 4, 1 and 3 were rolled
            remove the 1 die and sum the remaining dice for the final score, 13. This rolling method will produce above
            average characters.

        <h2 id="anchor-alignment">Alignment</h2>

        <div class="layout-2col">
          <p>
            Alignment is a broad description of the character&rsquo;s philosophy not a description of personality or
            &nbsp;a prescription for the character&rsquo;s behavior. It does, however, &nbsp;dictate to some extent how
            the character interacts with the world.
          </p>
          <p>Alignment is designated along two axes, This first is Law and Chaos. The second is Good and Evil.</p>
          <p>
            The Good and Evil axis is the simpler of the two. Good characters value life and act to preserve it. Evil
            characters place little value on the lives of others and would certainly never sacrifice their own.
          </p>
          <p>
            Law may be thought of as order. Lawful characters operate according to &nbsp;a code, whether it be personal,
            professional or religious. Chaos means operating according to personal whim. Lawful characters make
            decisions based on principles while Chaotic characters tend to do what feels right in the moment with little
            regard for consistency and often consequences.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game world operates according to these philosophies. Monsters, gods, cultures and some highly powerful
            magical-items are intrinsically tied to some combination of Law/Chaos and Good/Evil. The personal
            philosophies of the characters dictate their relationship to these forces and serve a guide to their
            choices.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="anchor-races">Races</h2>

        <div class="rules-section">
          <p>
            All character races may choose to be single classed with no level limits. Non-human races may choose to
            multi-class with level limits. Each entry specifies allowable class combinations and level limits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each entry begins with a list of features. Age, lifespan, height and weight may be rolled or simply used as
            a guide when creating characters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each non-human race knows its own language and Common. If the character receives additional languages due to
            high Intelligence they should select additional languages from the provided list first.
          </p>

                  At first level the Assassin character starts with 60 points to distribute among the sills Open Locks,
                  Move Silently, Hide In Shadows, Climb Walls, Eavesdrop, Read Languages. No more than 30 points may be
                  added to a single skill. Assassin characters gain an additional 22 points per level starting at level
                  2 and ending at level 20. The player may not assign any more than 11 points to any one skill at each
                  of these levels. No skill may ever exceed 99%.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Open Locks</strong> may be attempted by the Assassin but once per lock per level. Locks
                  themselves vary in difficulty with the best locks designed specifically to defeat tampering.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Move Silently</strong> you&rsquo;re quiet but not invisible. Clever use of terrain or
                  combining this skill others make it most effective. Success increases your chances to surprise enemies
                  by 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Hide In Shadows</strong> by remaining perfectly still the Assassin may conceal themselves in
                  an area of low light. Hide in Shadows never works if the Assassin is being directly observed and may
                  be defeated by light and certain types of spells or otherworldly vision. As with Move Silently, Hide
                  in Shadows increases your chances to surprise enemies by 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An Assassin may either be moving or hiding but never both. The bonus to Surprise granted by Move
                  Silently and Hide in Shadows are never cumulative.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Climb Walls</strong> is used when the Assassin free climbs or when under fire. The first roll
                  is made when the Assassin has climbed half the intended distance. Failure indicates a set back of some
                  kind. Failure by more than 20% indicates the Assassin falls and takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen.
                  Further rolls will be required to complete the climb.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Eavesdrop</strong> (Detect Noise) is used most commonly when the Assassin wishes to hear a
                  sound that may otherwise be muffled due to distance, background noise or because of an interposing
                  barrier such as a door. The Assassin may also use this skill to read lips. The Assassin must be able
                  to understand the language being spoken when using eavesdrop in this way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Read Languages</strong> is a measure of the Assassin&rsquo;s ability to use their current
                  knowledge of language to puzzle out the written word in languages they do not know. Languages adjacent
                  to those known by the Assassin are easier to figure out than distant languages. Some may be far too
                  foreign for the Assassin to read.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="flex-col-12">
                <p>
                  <strong>Assassinate</strong> is used whenever the Assassin succeeds a to hit-roll for back-stab and
                  before damage is rolled. The player has a percent chance to kill their target based on their level +/-
                  5% multiplied by the difference between the Assassin's level and the target's. For example a 5th level
                  Assassin attacking a 3rd level target would have an 80% chance to succeed. Base 70% + (5 - 3) * 5 =
                  80%. The same Assassin attacking a 7th level target would have a 60% chance to succeed. Base 70% + (5
                  - 7) * 5 = 60%. If the the Assassinate roll is successful, the target is instantly killed. If it
                  fails, back-stab damage is rolled as normal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Assassins may <strong>Disguise</strong> themselves to appear as any similar creature of either sex.
                  Disguise may alter their height by +/- 5 inches and make the Assassin look slimmer or appear much
                  heavier. Disguise can make the assassin appear to be virtually any class of character, a simple
                  pilgrim, a merchant, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Assassins who disguise themselves as generic creatures such as "Guard" have a small chance of being
                  spotted. When attempting to disguise themselves as a specific individual the chance of being spotted
                  increases significantly. The DM will calculate the chance of discovery and roll in secret. Careful
                  planning and execution can help mitigate this risk.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Poison.</strong> Assassins are skilled in the application of ingested and insinuated poisons.
                  Those able to find an alchemist both willing and able to manufacture such concoction may use any
                  skillfully. Others learn to specialize in the creation and application of a single poison either by
                  raising animals whose venom can be harvested or plants whose extracts can be refined. Assasins gain
                  this feature at 7th Level.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <strong>Languages.</strong> The Assassin may learn languages in addition to the those gained from
                  having a high Intelligence score. Languages gained from this feature are a reflection of the
                  Assassin&rsquo;s facility with language. The Assassin has picked these up conversationally rather than
                  formally and may not be able to read or write them. Languages chosen from this feature must be
                  currently spoken languages.

                  At first level the Bard character starts with 26 points to distribute among the skills Pick Pockets,
                  Climb Walls, Eavesdrop and Read Languages, no more than 13 points may be added to a single skill. Bard
                  characters gain an additional 15 points per level starting at level 2 and ending at level 20. The
                  player may not assign any more than 8 points to any one skill at each of these levels. No skill may
                  ever exceed 99%. The skills Influence, Inspire, Counter and Lore work as described below.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Pick Pockets</strong> is the skill used to lift (or plant) small personal items from
                  unsuspecting marks. The Thief may access pouches, pockets or even loose jewelry but may not obtain a
                  stowed item. If the thief fails their roll by more than 20% they&rsquo;ll be noticed by their target
                  or one of his allies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Climb Walls</strong> is used when the thief free climbs or when under fire. The first roll is
                  made when the thief has climbed half the intended distance. Failure indicates a set back of some kind.
                  Failure by more than 20% indicates the thief falls and takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen. Further
                  rolls will be required to complete the climb.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Eavesdrop</strong> (Detect Noise) is used most commonly when the Bard wishes to hear a sound
                  that may otherwise be muffled due to distance, background noise or because of an interposing barrier
                  such as a door. The Bard may also use this skill to read lips. The Bard must be able to understand the
                  language being spoken when using eavesdrop in this way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Read Languages</strong> is a measure of the Bard&rsquo;s ability to use their current
                  knowledge of language to puzzle out the written word in languages they do not know. Languages adjacent
                  to those known by the Bard are easier to figure out than distant languages. Some may be far too
                  foreign for the Bard to read.

                  <strong>Influence</strong> The Bard may use the power of their Rock to influence the behavior of those
                  who can hear shifting the crowd toward hostile, friendly or appropriate. Listeners save vs
                  Paralyzation at -1 for every 3 levels of the Bard. A failed save shifts the crowd as the Bard desires,
                  success shifts the crowd&rsquo;s attitude in the opposite direction. This ability may not be used to
                  influence anyone currently engaged in combat.

                  <strong>Inspire</strong> The Bard may use the power of their Rock to inspire those about to do battle.
                  The Bard must know the nature of the threat and have at least 3 minutes to perform before battle
                  begins. Those who listen are granted +1 to attack, +1 to saving throws and +2 to morale roles. This
                  effect lasts for 1 round per level of the Bard. Those currently in combat may not be inspired this
                  way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Counter</strong> Once per encounter or battle the bard can use the power of their Rock to
                  block incoming magical attacks or effects involving poetry or song or meant to influence characters
                  through commands or charms. During this time the Bard may only perform and move at a slow walk. Allies
                  within a 30&rsquo; radius receive this benefit. The Bard must save vs Spell to block these attacks. A
                  failed save or damage from weapons or spells ends this effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Lore</strong> Bards pursue broad knowledge with a zeal unknown to others granting them
                  knowledge of a great many subjects. Given 10 minutes to handle an item the Bard has a 5% chance per
                  level (max 95%) to identify it. This is not a magical identification but instead a recollection of
                  tales of the item, its owners and the feats they performed while carrying it. Great success grants the
                  bard greater recall.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Acquiring New Spells</strong> Bards have notoriously short-attention spans rendering the kind
                  of study required to be a Magic-User impossible. Any spells they gain from first to last are the
                  product of happenstance. The DM will provide (or ask the player to select) one first level spell.
                  Thereafter the Bard may only learn spells from scrolls or captured spell books and must spend time and
                  resources to learn these in the same way as a Magic-User.

                  Acquiring New Spells&nbsp;In game terms we call the divine power of Clerics spells for the sake of
                  keeping the rules simple. But in the game world Cleric&rsquo;s pray to their respective gods and are
                  granted the ability (by their god) to perform miracles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order for a Cleric to learn new prayers he or she should remain in good standing with their local
                  temple which will in turn guide the Cleric&rsquo;s religious study helping the Cleric to learn new
                  prayers for 1st and 2nd level spells. Cleric&rsquo;s of 5th level or higher will encounter a teacher
                  of the DM&rsquo;s design capable of instructing the Cleric in prayers for 3rd-5th level spells. A
                  divine servant of the deity in question will contact the Cleric of 11th level in order to provide
                  instruction for spells 6th level and higher.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some Clerics answer the call of their deity to venture far from established temples. In this case the
                  deity or one of its servants will see to the Cleric&rsquo;s education.

                  Captured prayer books filled with the divine (or profane) prayers to other gods are of no value to
                  Clerics. Additionally Cleric&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t have magical scrolls to learn from since prayers may
                  be answered but not saved for later.
                </p>
                <p>Clerics may however find and later make relics.</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Relics</strong> At 7th level the Cleric gains the ability to imbue sacred materials with a
                  fraction of divine power to create minor relics dedicated to their god. Think Prayer Beads.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At 12th level the Cleric gains the ability to imbue sacred materials with a portion of divine power to
                  create major relics dedicated to their god. Think Holy Avenger.

            <h4>Turn Undead</h4>

            <p>
              The Cleric rolls a d20 to determine if they can turn undead of the given type. A successful turn undead
              attempt affects 1d12 creatures of the same type. In any combat the cleric may only make a single attempt
              to turn undead of each type.

                  Druids in this game use the Cleric Experience and Spell tables from this volume. In all other regards
                  Druids work exactly as described in the AD&amp;D PHB excepting the rules limiting the number of Druids
                  at a given level and having to challenge an existing Druid to attain that level. These rules are
                  simply ignored.

                <p>
                  Acquiring New Spells&nbsp;In game terms we call the primordial power of Druids spells for the sake of
                  keeping the rules simple. But in the game world Druids&rsquo;s tap into the primal forces of nature to
                  perform miracles.

                <p>
                  In order for the Druid to strengthen their connection to nature and thus increase their number of
                  &ldquo;spells&rdquo; the druid needs to spend time reconnecting with nature in their native
                  environment. During this time of meditation and reflection the Druid will find many teachers in the
                  trees and the winds and mundane and magical creatures of the forest.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Druid power comes from their connection to nature. No written word can capture that connection, no ink
                  inscribed on something dead can preserve it. Druids themselves may be (but are not required to be)
                  completely illiterate. Druids therefore do not have scrolls but they may find and later make fetishes
                  (see below).
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Fetishes</strong> At 7th level the Druid gains the ability imbue natural materials with a
                  fraction of primordial power to create minor fetishes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At 12th level the Druid gains the ability to imbue natural materials with a portion of primordial
                  power to create major relics. Think &ldquo;Staff of the Woodlands&rdquo;.

                  <strong>Weapon Specialization</strong> When creating a fighter the player may select a single melee
                  weapon to be &ldquo;specialized&rdquo; with. Weapon specialization grants the fighter one extra attack
                  every 2 rounds ( see fighter table &ldquo;Melee Attacks&rdquo; above) and +1 to hit and +2 damage
                  owing to their skill with the chosen weapon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fighters with Dexterity higher than their Strength may instead choose a ranged weapon specialization.
                  This benefit allows the fighter to add 1 to the weapon&rsquo;s rate of fire and adds +1 to hit and +2
                  damage as above.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Weapon Mastery</strong> At 5th level the fighter is so practiced with their specialized weapon
                  that they receive an additional +2 to hit and +1 to damage when using that weapon for a total of +3 to
                  hit and +3 to damage.

                <p>
                  <strong>Cleave</strong> Starting at first level when the fighter uses a weapon to kill an enemy with
                  less than 1hd the fighter may make an additional attack against another creature also with less than 1
                  hd. The fighter may use this feature every round. The total attacks a Fighter can make in any given
                  round including attacks granted by level or specialization may not exceed the Fighter&rsquo;s current
                  level with the exception that cleave always grants a minimum of 1 extra attack. This feature improves
                  at levels 7 and 13.

                  To become a Knight the player character must have served under a more experienced Knight as both page
                  (ages 8-13) and squire (ages 14 - 20+). When the mentoring Knight is satisfied with the completion of
                  the player character&rsquo;s training the mentor grants the PC the title &ldquo;Knight.&rdquo;
                </p>
                <p>
                  The 1st level Knight begins their career at the completion of this training as a Knight Errant or
                  Adventuring Knight. The Player Character must then seek out great deeds to distinguish themselves
                  among their peers and thereby receive an invitation to join a knightly order.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All Knights regardless of affiliation are expected to adhere to a certain code of conduct including
                  Fair Play, Nobility, Honor, Valor, Courtesy and Loyalty. Most Lords and Orders will require Knights to
                  make additional commitments to country or cause. Affiliated Knights may receive commands from their
                  Lord or Order that they&rsquo;ll be expected to obey.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Knightly Weapons</strong> The Knight receives +1 to hit and +2 to damage with the Long Sword,
                  Great Sword, Battle Axe, Halberd, Footman&rsquo;s Mace and Lance.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Valour</strong> +2 to saves against Fear and Charm</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Horsemanship</strong> The knight is an expert in selecting mounts and receives +1 to hit with
                  melee weapons while mounted.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="flex-col-12">
                <p>
                  <strong>For Glory</strong> The knight must (when able) attack the most difficult or (in)famous foe.
                  The knight receives a bonus to hit and damage equal to the difference between the knight&rsquo;s level
                  and his enemy&rsquo;s Level or HD.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Example 1: 1st Level Knight vs Orc (1HD) Attack as Normal<br />Example 2: 1st Level Knight vs Ogre
                  (4HD) +3/+3<br />Example 3: 3rd Level Knight vs Ogre (4HD) +1/+1<br />Example 4: 5th Level Knight vs
                  Orc (1HD) Attack as Normal (not -4/-4)
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Formal Challenge</strong> When facing a foe worthy of single combat the knight may issue a
                  formal challenge listing his or her titles and deeds. This challenge may appeal to the foe&rsquo;s
                  honor or simply insult the foe&rsquo;s ego but in either case that foe will engage the Knight in
                  single combat to increase their own fame or infamy. Lesser foes will avoid this combat for fear of
                  their leader&rsquo;s wrath.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The knight may issue this challenge to any enemy but don&rsquo;t mistake bravery for foolishness.
                  Knights don&rsquo;t expect casters, brigands or deceivers to honor the challenge.

                  know. These spells must always be of a spell level the Magic-User can cast including the newly
                  attained spell level if applicable. Spells learned in this way do not require days of study as with
                  captured books and scrolls since they represent the culmination of prior days of study.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Magic-Users may also accrue new spells by studying captured spell books or spell scrolls. Acquiring
                  new spells in this way requires time to study the material in question. The Magic-User will need to
                  spend 1 day per spell level to complete their study and fully integrate the knowledge. Scrolls used in
                  this way are consumed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Only the most exceptional Magic-Users are able to learn every spell. Use the following chart to
                  determine if you can know a spell.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Increases (or unfortunate decreases) to intelligence will allow or compel future re-rolls. Magic-Users
                  may cast spells from scrolls even if they&rsquo;re not able to learn the spell.

                  <strong>Potions and Scrolls</strong> When the Magic-User reaches 7th level they may begin to brew
                  potions and scribe scrolls. The brewing of potions requires time, space and an extensive laboratory
                  not to mention exotic components. Potions of Storm Giant Strength don&rsquo;t, as they say, grow on
                  trees. The creation of scrolls requires time, the material components of the spell to be scribed and
                  fine parchments and inks.

              A Paladin embodies all that a Knight is coupled with the religious conviction of a Cleric. Where
              Knight&rsquo;s may be errant a Paladin must always be sworn to a religious order.
            </p>

              Paladins gain the Knightly Weapons and Horsemanship features of the Knight class in addition to the powers
              and limits places on Paladins in the AD&amp;D PHB p22

                  Thief characters have 7 skills that represent various aspects of their trade. The back-stab skill
                  increases at the rate indicated in the above table while the remaining 6 skills are increased by the
                  player. At first level the thief character starts with 60 points to distribute among their remaining 6
                  skills, no more than 30 points may be added to a single skill. Thief characters gain an additional 22
                  points per level starting at level 2 and ending at level 20. The player may not assign any more than
                  11 points to any one skill at each of these levels. No skill may ever exceed 99%.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Pick Pockets</strong> is the skill used to lift (or plant) small personal items from
                  unsuspecting marks. The Thief may access pouches, pockets or even loose jewelry but may not obtain a
                  stowed item. If the thief fails their roll by more than 20% they&rsquo;ll be noticed by their target
                  or one of his allies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Open Locks</strong> may be attempted by the thief but once per lock per level. Locks
                  themselves vary in difficulty with the best locks designed specifically to defeat tampering.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Thieves may spend time inspecting a lock before attempting to pick it. If the thief spends 1 turn
                  inspecting a lock they may determine whether the lock is within their current skill and gain a 10%
                  bonus to their Open Locks roll. The thief gains a 5% for each additional turn spent inspecting the
                  lock to a maximum bonus of 20%. A thief may never have more than a 99% chance to succeed at opening a
                  lock.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Finding and Removing Traps</strong> are two related functions that need to be rolled
                  separately. Searching for a trap in this way requires the thief to spend 1 turn investigating the area
                  suspected of being trapped. This area may be no larger than 10 square feet per turn of investigation.
                  A failed find traps roll indicates the thief is satisfied no trap exists. Once a trap is found the
                  thief may roll to remove the trap.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="flex-col-12">
                <p>
                  Any clever adventurer may find a trap without the need to role. Some traps are far too dangerous to
                  disarm and should instead be thoughtfully avoided.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Move Silently</strong> you&rsquo;re quiet but not invisible. Clever use of terrain or
                  combining this skill others make it most effective. Success increases your chances to surprise enemies
                  by 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Hide In Shadows</strong> by remaining perfectly still the thief may conceal themselves in an
                  area of low light. Hide in Shadows never works if the thief is being directly observed and may be
                  defeated by light and certain types of spells or otherworldly vision. As with Move Silently, Hide in
                  Shadows increases your chances to surprise enemies by 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A Thief may either be moving or hiding but never both. The bonus to Surprise granted by Move Silently
                  and Hide in Shadows are never cumulative.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Climb Walls</strong> is used when the thief free climbs or when under fire. The first roll is
                  made when the thief has climbed half the intended distance. Failure indicates a set back of some kind.
                  Failure by more than 20% indicates the thief falls and takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen. Further
                  rolls will be required to complete the climb.

        <h2 id="anchor-adventuring">Adventuring</h2>

        <h3 id="anchor-combat">Combat</h3>

        <p>
          Combat may begin in many ways but most commonly it begins when hostile forces meet in the field, when
          negotiation between two or more parties dissolves into violence, when one hostile force lays an ambush for
          another or, when two hostile forces stumble upon one another.
        </p>

        <h4 id="anchor-initiative">Initiative</h4>

        <div class="layout-2col">
          <p>
            When hostile forces meet in the field the players and monsters will roll initiative dice. The DM will roll
            one die for the monsters or may at his discretion roll 1 die for each monster group or significant monster.
            The character or monster with the highest roll starts combat. In the event that communication breaks down
            and combat erupts the first player or monster or monster group to break will go first. No initiative dice
            are rolled.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the first actor in the combat completes their turn that individual will call on the next actor in the
            combat and so on until each player and monster has taken their turn. The last actor in the current round
            will pick the first actor in the next round. If the monsters act last in a given round they&rsquo;ll always
            choose themselves to act first in the following round.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 id="anchor-surprise">Surprise</h4>

        <div class="layout-2col">
          <p>
            When hostile forces stumble upon each other they roll surprise dice. If one side succeeds while the other
            fails that side receives a surprise round. If both sides tie for failure or success, surprise is bypassed
            and initiative is rolled for as above. When one side lays an ambush for the other only the side laying in
            ambush rolls for surprise. If the ambushing side has plenty of time to prepare or is able to give themselves
            some other advantage they may gain surprise without needing to roll. A cautious group, alert to surprise may
            never be automatically surprised.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note that surprise is indicated differently throughout the rules. Elves and Halflings for instance
            have a 4 in 6 chance to surprise enemies where Rangers may only be surprised on a 1 in 6. The DM will set
            the actual conditions of surprise at the time it occurs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 id="anchor-weapons-and-spells">Weapons and Spells</h4>

        <div class="layout-2col">
          <p>
            Combat comes in three flavors, melee, missile and area of affect. Weapons are always swung, thrown or shot
            and classify as melee, missile or both in the case of thrown weapons. Spells may be melee (when the range is
            touch), missile if they affect a single target or area of effect when they affect all targets in an area.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a combatant is in melee range they may only use melee weapons, thrown missiles or cast spells with a
            range of self or touch. Melee is too dynamic for missile weapons or ranged spells to be deployed. Combatants
            who fire missiles or cast spells into a melee should do so with great caution for failure to hit your target
            means you may hit an ally. The DM will calculate this chance based on the circumstance and instruct the
            player to roll accordingly.
          </p>

        <h4 id="anchor-cover-and-concealment">Cover and Concealment</h4>

        <div class="layout-2col">
          <p>
            When being fired upon by the enemy it makes sense to to take cover behind impermeable barriers such as walls
            or to obscure the attackers line of sight by hiding in dense underbrush. Doing so confers an AC bonus to the
            evading party.

          <p>
            Cover is not a perfect defense. While projectiles of insufficient mass that must travel in a straight line
            may be blocked by cover it can&rsquo;t protect against spells that are able to bypass it (by exploding in
            the air above it for example) or missiles of sufficient mass to destroy it, such as a boulder hurled by a
            trebuchet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Concealment can take various forms. Dense fog may make it harder to spot a target but can&rsquo;t stop the
            flight path of a missile. A dense hedgerow may also block vision but allow some some missiles (such as
            arrows) through while others (a thrown axe) may become effectively entangled.
          </p>
          <p>Players and DMs should use their best judgment regarding cover and concealment.</p>

            From time to time players and their adversaries may wish to hurl fragile containers containing flammable or
            toxic liquids such as oil, acid or holy water. The range for such missiles is 1/2/3 and ROF is 1. Most
            containers made to contain these fluids are sturdy and a save must be made to see if they break on impact
            but players may obtain containers of these fluids that will always break at the cost of making them more
            risky to transport.

        <h3 id="anchor-time">Time</h3>

        <div class="layout-2col">
          <p>
            Time may be tracked in the game in different ways. Most often we track time using &ldquo;game time.&rdquo;
            Using game time we simply say that an amount of minutes, hours or days have passed and continue with the
            game. If the characters are making a simple safe journey lasting three days then three days for the
            characters may pass in the time it takes the DM to say, &ldquo;three days later.&rdquo; If the session needs
            to end when the characters are adventuring then game time might stand still until the start of the next
            session.
          </p>
          <p>
            Travel is not always safe. Sometimes the characters are passing through dangerous territory or may need to
            travel quickly. In cases where travel has some element of danger it may become an adventure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Players should remember that both allied and opposed factions are bound by the same time and physical laws
            as their characters. It&rsquo;s often desirable (or unavoidable) to use game time to say &ldquo;five weeks
            later&rdquo; but doing so allows game factions 5 weeks to advance their goals.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 id="anchor-exploration-time">Exploration Time</h4>

        <p>
          During exploration time passes using &ldquo;exploration time&rdquo;. Exploration time is a function of how
          much distance the characters can cover or what size area they can search in a given amount of time (see
          below). Generally speaking exploration time is divided into three paces slow, normal and fast where slow
          covers the least area with the most caution and fast the most area with the least caution.
        </p>

        <h4 id="anchor-dungeon-exploration">Dungeon Exploration</h4>

        <div class="layout-2col">
          <p>
            Dungeon exploration is measured in a unit of time called the &ldquo;Game Turn&rdquo; or simply turn. A turn
            equals 10 minutes. Please note the duration of most light sources is measured in turns. Characters may move
            through the dungeon at one of three paces slow, normal and fast. Movement is always assumed to occur at the
            pace of the slowest character, players may always indicate otherwise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Slow.&nbsp;Characters move at 10&rsquo; x movement rate. When doing so they may detect approaching enemies
            before being detected themselves. Traps may be noticed without rolling and Find Traps rolls are done with a
            20% bonus. Known traps are easily avoided.
          </p>
          <p>
            Normal.&nbsp;Characters move at 20&rsquo; x movement rate. When doing so normal rules for surprise apply.
            Traps may only be noticed by rolling Find Traps. Known traps may or may not be stumbled over depending on
            their nature and prior precautions. For example a clearly indicated pressure plate in a wide hallway may be
            avoided while a trip wire that must be stepped over would require a check to see if a character makes a
            mis-step.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast.&nbsp;Characters move at 30&rsquo; x movement rate. When doing so characters will always be surprised
            by enemies. Traps may only be noticed by rolling Find Traps and this check is made with a 20% penalty.
            Characters have a chance to stumble over known traps no matter what precautions have been taken.
          </p>
          <p>
            Monsters are subject to the same rules of movement. Their pace may modify the above rules. Generally
            speaking parties moving at a slower pace have an advantage over those moving at a faster pace while parties
            moving at the same pace cancel advantages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any party moving through its home is considered to have the &ldquo;home court&rdquo; advantage. This party

          Monsters traverse dangerous environments at unpredictable intervals. The DM checks to see if these encounters
          occur at an interval of turns appropriate to the environment. Players should therefore spend turns with care.

            As dungeon exploration is measured in feet and turns, wilderness exploration is measured in leagues and
            hours. 1 league is equal to 3 miles.

            While these environments may be traversed at various rates (see Dungeon Exploration above) those rates can
            be affected by vehicles, mounts, magic and possibly equipment. Given that complexity the DM will fill in
            rules as necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Searching a league of wilderness costs an amount of time equal to the time it takes to traverse that
            terrain. For example, searching 1 league of forest costs 4 hours.

        <div class="layout-2col">
          <p>
            There will be times during the course of play that will naturally lead to the characters needing to take a
            break from adventuring. Spell casters need time to learn new spells and any character may need to take rest
            to recover from grievous wounds. The players may also decide that their characters simply wish to take some
            time off from questing in order to spend more time with their treasure.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter the case this is a time for the players to consider what their characters may wish to achieve
            outside of the adventure. A Thief may wish to find a fence, a Knight may search for a squire and the Fighter
            may simply wish to imbibe and be merry. A character may even wish to hire a group of adventurers to send off
            to achieve some goal the player characters don&rsquo;t have time to address.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any character may achieve or make progress toward achieving any goal by communicating it with the DM. Simple
            goals may need no more investment than the mere statement of intent while others may require additional
            in-game interactions to be carried out by the player and DM individually.
