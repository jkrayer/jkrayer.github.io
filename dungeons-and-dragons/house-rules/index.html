          <h2 id="anchor-foreward">Foreward</h2>

          <p>
            Due to a conflict between a vacation and the delivery of my pre-order of the 5th Edition Player&rsquo;s
            handbook I wound up at the Gamer&rsquo;s Gambit in Saddlebrook, NJ. My aim was simply to get a pre-release
            copy to read on vacation but I left with an invitation to play at the store.
          </p>
          <p>Thus began my second love affair with Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
          <p>
            I&rsquo;d unintentionally taken a long hiatus, of perhaps 15 years, from playing D&amp;D as a serious hobby
            and thought (rather naively) I could pick up where I had left off. The old muscles had atrophied from disuse
            however, but with the patience of new friends they slowly redeveloped.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the old skills returned so did the desire to tinker with the rules. For various reasons this can be more
            difficult in 5E. Out of frustration I began to look back at the D&amp;D of my youth and discover (admittedly
            late) the OSR.
          </p>
          <p>
            Time passed, the unspecified plague of unknown origin ended in-person play and dispersed friends, isolated
            in their homes, were looking for entertainment. A new group formed and in this environment the opportunity
            to experiment with different games emerged.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was here that I began to analyze TSR era D&amp;D and its retro-clones to find a system more satisfying to
            plan and to run. The analysis wasn&rsquo;t easy. I&rsquo;m strongly drawn to the simplicity of the various
            basic boxes of D&amp;D and to Old School Essentials. I have a large amount of nostalgia for 2E AD&amp;D. In
            the end I decided on AD&amp;D. Not because I think AD&amp;D is perfect. Not because I love seeing &ldquo;E.
            Gary Gygax&rdquo; on the covers of my books; which I do. But because I felt then, as I do now, that AD&amp;D
            is a strong foundation to build a game on.
          </p>
          <p>
            With one modern AD&amp;D game behind me and a lot of time to consider my next move I&rsquo;ve decided
            (because I couldn&rsquo;t stop myself) to follow in the footsteps of so many fools. This is the start of my
            quixotical quest for the &ldquo;Fantasy Heartbreaker.&rdquo; The perfect game that makes the DM and all of
            his players happy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The aim is a simplified game that&rsquo;s fun to play, that can be easily modified to suit each new campaign
            but that remains AD&amp;D at the core. I could go into a great deal of depth as to why but the very short
            reason is the ability to play a lot of wonderful adventures written for TSR era D&amp;D with little or no
            modification.
          </p>
          <p>
            All who participate in the game are encouraged to contribute to its evolution. I hope for this document to
            be the first step to a more fun, more customized game and I look forward to playing with all of you.
          </p>

          <p>
            The document you&rsquo;re reading now extends and supersedes the AD&amp;D Players Handbook. In some places
            it alters tables or simplifies or changes rules. In other places it moves rules from the AD&amp;D Dungeon
            Master&rsquo;s guide for the sake of clarity. Having the AD&amp;D Players Handbook available during play is
            helpful but not strictly necessary. The OSRIC Compendium may also be used.
          </p>

          <p>These rules may be revised at any time for consistency and clarity.</p>

            <p>
              Roll 4d6 six times. Remove the lowest die from each roll. For Example, if &nbsp;a 6, 4, 1 and 3 were
              rolled remove the 1 die and sum the remaining dice for the final score, 13. This rolling method will
              produce above average characters.

            <p>
              Mulligan. If 2 or more scores of 6 or less or 4 or more scores of 9 or less scrap this character and start

          <h2 id="anchor-alignment">Alignment</h2>

          <div class="layout-2col">
            <p>
              Alignment is a broad description of the character&rsquo;s philosophy not a description of personality or
              &nbsp;a prescription for the character&rsquo;s behavior. It does, however, &nbsp;dictate to some extent
              how the character interacts with the world.
            </p>
            <p>Alignment is designated along two axes, This first is Law and Chaos. The second is Good and Evil.</p>
            <p>
              The Good and Evil axis is the simpler of the two. Good characters value life and act to preserve it. Evil
              characters place little value on the lives of others and would certainly never sacrifice their own.
            </p>
            <p>
              Law may be thought of as order. Lawful characters operate according to &nbsp;a code, whether it be
              personal, professional or religious. Chaos means operating according to personal whim. Lawful characters
              make decisions based on principles while Chaotic characters tend to do what feels right in the moment with
              little regard for consistency and often consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
              The game world operates according to these philosophies. Monsters, gods, cultures and some highly powerful
              magical-items are intrinsically tied to some combination of Law/Chaos and Good/Evil. The personal
              philosophies of the characters dictate their relationship to these forces and serve a guide to their
              choices.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="anchor-races">Races</h2>

          <div class="rules-section">
            <p>
              All character races may choose to be single classed with no level limits. Non-human races may choose to
              multi-class with level limits. Each entry specifies allowable class combinations and level limits.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each entry begins with a list of features. Age, lifespan, height and weight may be rolled or simply used
              as a guide when creating characters.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each non-human race knows its own language and Common. If the character receives additional languages due
              to high Intelligence they should select additional languages from the provided list first.

                  <p>
                    At first level the Assassin character starts with 60 points to distribute among the sills Open
                    Locks, Move Silently, Hide In Shadows, Climb Walls, Eavesdrop, Read Languages. No more than 30
                    points may be added to a single skill. Assassin characters gain an additional 22 points per level
                    starting at level 2 and ending at level 20. The player may not assign any more than 11 points to any
                    one skill at each of these levels. No skill may ever exceed 99%.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Open Locks</strong> may be attempted by the Assassin but once per lock per level. Locks
                    themselves vary in difficulty with the best locks designed specifically to defeat tampering.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Move Silently</strong> you&rsquo;re quiet but not invisible. Clever use of terrain or
                    combining this skill others make it most effective. Success increases your chances to surprise
                    enemies by 1.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Hide In Shadows</strong> by remaining perfectly still the Assassin may conceal themselves in
                    an area of low light. Hide in Shadows never works if the Assassin is being directly observed and may
                    be defeated by light and certain types of spells or otherworldly vision. As with Move Silently, Hide
                    in Shadows increases your chances to surprise enemies by 1.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An Assassin may either be moving or hiding but never both. The bonus to Surprise granted by Move
                    Silently and Hide in Shadows are never cumulative.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Climb Walls</strong> is used when the Assassin free climbs or when under fire. The first
                    roll is made when the Assassin has climbed half the intended distance. Failure indicates a set back
                    of some kind. Failure by more than 20% indicates the Assassin falls and takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet
                    fallen. Further rolls will be required to complete the climb.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Eavesdrop</strong> (Detect Noise) is used most commonly when the Assassin wishes to hear a
                    sound that may otherwise be muffled due to distance, background noise or because of an interposing
                    barrier such as a door. The Assassin may also use this skill to read lips. The Assassin must be able
                    to understand the language being spoken when using eavesdrop in this way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Read Languages</strong> is a measure of the Assassin&rsquo;s ability to use their current
                    knowledge of language to puzzle out the written word in languages they do not know. Languages
                    adjacent to those known by the Assassin are easier to figure out than distant languages. Some may be
                    far too foreign for the Assassin to read.
                  </p>

                <div class="flex-col-12">
                  <p>
                    <strong>Assassinate</strong> is used whenever the Assassin succeeds a to hit-roll for back-stab and
                    before damage is rolled. The player has a percent chance to kill their target based on their level
                    +/- 5% multiplied by the difference between the Assassin's level and the target's. For example a 5th
                    level Assassin attacking a 3rd level target would have an 80% chance to succeed. Base 70% + (5 - 3)
                    * 5 = 80%. The same Assassin attacking a 7th level target would have a 60% chance to succeed. Base
                    70% + (5 - 7) * 5 = 60%. If the the Assassinate roll is successful, the target is instantly killed.
                    If it fails, back-stab damage is rolled as normal.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Assassins may <strong>Disguise</strong> themselves to appear as any similar creature of either sex.
                    Disguise may alter their height by +/- 5 inches and make the Assassin look slimmer or appear much
                    heavier. Disguise can make the assassin appear to be virtually any class of character, a simple
                    pilgrim, a merchant, etc.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Assassins who disguise themselves as generic creatures such as "Guard" have a small chance of being
                    spotted. When attempting to disguise themselves as a specific individual the chance of being spotted
                    increases significantly. The DM will calculate the chance of discovery and roll in secret. Careful
                    planning and execution can help mitigate this risk.
                  </p>

                    <strong>Poison.</strong> Assassins are skilled in the application of ingested and insinuated
                    poisons. Those able to find an alchemist both willing and able to manufacture such concoction may
                    use any skillfully. Others learn to specialize in the creation and application of a single poison
                    either by raising animals whose venom can be harvested or plants whose extracts can be refined.
                    Assasins gain this feature at 7th Level.

                  <p>
                    <strong>Languages.</strong> The Assassin may learn languages in addition to the those gained from
                    having a high Intelligence score. Languages gained from this feature are a reflection of the
                    Assassin&rsquo;s facility with language. The Assassin has picked these up conversationally rather
                    than formally and may not be able to read or write them. Languages chosen from this feature must be
                    currently spoken languages.

                    At first level the Bard character starts with 26 points to distribute among the skills Pick Pockets,
                    Climb Walls, Eavesdrop and Read Languages, no more than 13 points may be added to a single skill.
                    Bard characters gain an additional 15 points per level starting at level 2 and ending at level 20.
                    The player may not assign any more than 8 points to any one skill at each of these levels. No skill
                    may ever exceed 99%. The skills Influence, Inspire, Counter and Lore work as described below.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Pick Pockets</strong> is the skill used to lift (or plant) small personal items from
                    unsuspecting marks. The Thief may access pouches, pockets or even loose jewelry but may not obtain a
                    stowed item. If the thief fails their roll by more than 20% they&rsquo;ll be noticed by their target
                    or one of his allies.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Climb Walls</strong> is used when the thief free climbs or when under fire. The first roll
                    is made when the thief has climbed half the intended distance. Failure indicates a set back of some
                    kind. Failure by more than 20% indicates the thief falls and takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen.
                    Further rolls will be required to complete the climb.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Eavesdrop</strong> (Detect Noise) is used most commonly when the Bard wishes to hear a sound
                    that may otherwise be muffled due to distance, background noise or because of an interposing barrier
                    such as a door. The Bard may also use this skill to read lips. The Bard must be able to understand
                    the language being spoken when using eavesdrop in this way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Read Languages</strong> is a measure of the Bard&rsquo;s ability to use their current
                    knowledge of language to puzzle out the written word in languages they do not know. Languages
                    adjacent to those known by the Bard are easier to figure out than distant languages. Some may be far
                    too foreign for the Bard to read.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Influence</strong> The Bard may use the power of their Rock to influence the behavior of
                    those who can hear shifting the crowd toward hostile, friendly or appropriate. Listeners save vs
                    Paralyzation at -1 for every 3 levels of the Bard. A failed save shifts the crowd as the Bard
                    desires, success shifts the crowd&rsquo;s attitude in the opposite direction. This ability may not
                    be used to influence anyone currently engaged in combat.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="flex-col-12">
                  <p>
                    <strong>Inspire</strong> The Bard may use the power of their Rock to inspire those about to do
                    battle. The Bard must know the nature of the threat and have at least 3 minutes to perform before
                    battle begins. Those who listen are granted +1 to attack, +1 to saving throws and +2 to morale
                    roles. This effect lasts for 1 round per level of the Bard. Those currently in combat may not be
                    inspired this way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Counter</strong> Once per encounter or battle the bard can use the power of their Rock to
                    block incoming magical attacks or effects involving poetry or song or meant to influence characters
                    through commands or charms. During this time the Bard may only perform and move at a slow walk.
                    Allies within a 30&rsquo; radius receive this benefit. The Bard must save vs Spell to block these
                    attacks. A failed save or damage from weapons or spells ends this effect.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Lore</strong> Bards pursue broad knowledge with a zeal unknown to others granting them
                    knowledge of a great many subjects. Given 10 minutes to handle an item the Bard has a 5% chance per
                    level (max 95%) to identify it. This is not a magical identification but instead a recollection of
                    tales of the item, its owners and the feats they performed while carrying it. Great success grants
                    the bard greater recall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Acquiring New Spells</strong> Bards have notoriously short-attention spans rendering the
                    kind of study required to be a Magic-User impossible. Any spells they gain from first to last are
                    the product of happenstance. The DM will provide (or ask the player to select) one first level
                    spell. Thereafter the Bard may only learn spells from scrolls or captured spell books and must spend
                    time and resources to learn these in the same way as a Magic-User.
                  </p>

                    Acquiring New Spells&nbsp;In game terms we call the divine power of Clerics spells for the sake of
                    keeping the rules simple. But in the game world Cleric&rsquo;s pray to their respective gods and are
                    granted the ability (by their god) to perform miracles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In order for a Cleric to learn new prayers he or she should remain in good standing with their local
                    temple which will in turn guide the Cleric&rsquo;s religious study helping the Cleric to learn new
                    prayers for 1st and 2nd level spells. Cleric&rsquo;s of 5th level or higher will encounter a teacher
                    of the DM&rsquo;s design capable of instructing the Cleric in prayers for 3rd-5th level spells. A
                    divine servant of the deity in question will contact the Cleric of 11th level in order to provide
                    instruction for spells 6th level and higher.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some Clerics answer the call of their deity to venture far from established temples. In this case
                    the deity or one of its servants will see to the Cleric&rsquo;s education.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Captured prayer books filled with the divine (or profane) prayers to other gods are of no value to
                    Clerics. Additionally Cleric&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t have magical scrolls to learn from since prayers
                    may be answered but not saved for later.
                  </p>
                  <p>Clerics may however find and later make relics.</p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Relics</strong> At 7th level the Cleric gains the ability to imbue sacred materials with a
                    fraction of divine power to create minor relics dedicated to their god. Think Prayer Beads.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At 12th level the Cleric gains the ability to imbue sacred materials with a portion of divine power
                    to create major relics dedicated to their god. Think Holy Avenger.

              <h4>Turn Undead</h4>

              <p>
                The Cleric rolls a d20 to determine if they can turn undead of the given type. A successful turn undead
                attempt affects 1d12 creatures of the same type. In any combat the cleric may only make a single attempt
                to turn undead of each type.

                    Druids in this game use the Cleric Experience and Spell tables from this volume. In all other

                    of Druids at a given level and having to challenge an existing Druid to attain that level. These

                    &ldquo;spells&rdquo; the druid needs to spend time reconnecting with nature in their native
                    environment. During this time of meditation and reflection the Druid will find many teachers in the

                    fetishes (see below).

                    <strong>Fetishes</strong> At 7th level the Druid gains the ability imbue natural materials with a
                    fraction of primordial power to create minor fetishes.

                  <p>
                    At 12th level the Druid gains the ability to imbue natural materials with a portion of primordial
                    power to create major relics. Think &ldquo;Staff of the Woodlands&rdquo;.

                    <strong>Weapon Specialization</strong> When creating a fighter the player may select a single melee
                    weapon to be &ldquo;specialized&rdquo; with. Weapon specialization grants the fighter one extra
                    attack every 2 rounds ( see fighter table &ldquo;Melee Attacks&rdquo; above) and +1 to hit and +2
                    damage owing to their skill with the chosen weapon.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fighters with Dexterity higher than their Strength may instead choose a ranged weapon
                    specialization. This benefit allows the fighter to add 1 to the weapon&rsquo;s rate of fire and adds
                    +1 to hit and +2 damage as above.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Weapon Mastery</strong> At 5th level the fighter is so practiced with their specialized
                    weapon that they receive an additional +2 to hit and +1 to damage when using that weapon for a total
                    of +3 to hit and +3 to damage.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="flex-col-12">
                  <p>
                    <strong>Cleave</strong> Starting at first level when the fighter uses a weapon to kill an enemy with
                    less than 1hd the fighter may make an additional attack against another creature also with less than
                    1 hd. The fighter may use this feature every round. The total attacks a Fighter can make in any
                    given round including attacks granted by level or specialization may not exceed the Fighter&rsquo;s
                    current level with the exception that cleave always grants a minimum of 1 extra attack. This feature
                    improves at levels 7 and 13.

                    To become a Knight the player character must have served under a more experienced Knight as both
                    page (ages 8-13) and squire (ages 14 - 20+). When the mentoring Knight is satisfied with the
                    completion of the player character&rsquo;s training the mentor grants the PC the title
                    &ldquo;Knight.&rdquo;
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The 1st level Knight begins their career at the completion of this training as a Knight Errant or
                    Adventuring Knight. The Player Character must then seek out great deeds to distinguish themselves
                    among their peers and thereby receive an invitation to join a knightly order.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All Knights regardless of affiliation are expected to adhere to a certain code of conduct including
                    Fair Play, Nobility, Honor, Valor, Courtesy and Loyalty. Most Lords and Orders will require Knights
                    to make additional commitments to country or cause. Affiliated Knights may receive commands from
                    their Lord or Order that they&rsquo;ll be expected to obey.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Knightly Weapons</strong> The Knight receives +1 to hit and +2 to damage with the Long
                    Sword, Great Sword, Battle Axe, Halberd, Footman&rsquo;s Mace and Lance.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Valour</strong> +2 to saves against Fear and Charm</p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Horsemanship</strong> The knight is an expert in selecting mounts and receives +1 to hit
                    with melee weapons while mounted.
                  </p>

                    <strong>For Glory</strong> The knight must (when able) attack the most difficult or (in)famous foe.
                    The knight receives a bonus to hit and damage equal to the difference between the knight&rsquo;s
                    level and his enemy&rsquo;s Level or HD.
                  </p>

                    Orc (1HD) Attack as Normal (not -4/-4)

                  <p>
                    <strong>Formal Challenge</strong> When facing a foe worthy of single combat the knight may issue a
                    formal challenge listing his or her titles and deeds. This challenge may appeal to the foe&rsquo;s
                    honor or simply insult the foe&rsquo;s ego but in either case that foe will engage the Knight in
                    single combat to increase their own fame or infamy. Lesser foes will avoid this combat for fear of
                    their leader&rsquo;s wrath.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The knight may issue this challenge to any enemy but don&rsquo;t mistake bravery for foolishness.
                    Knights don&rsquo;t expect casters, brigands or deceivers to honor the challenge.

                    Acquiring New Spells&nbsp;One who is a Magic-User is by nature the studious sort. It&rsquo;s
                    therefore assumed that Magic-User characters spend much of their free time in study and
                    consideration of the nuance of each casting. Due to this constant study Magic-Users may gain a new
                    spell when gaining a new level. Spells gained for advancing in levels need not be rolled for as with
                    learning spells from scrolls and books (below) but they do count toward the maximum number of spells
                    the magic-user may know. These spells must always be of a spell level the Magic-User can cast
                    including the newly attained spell level if applicable. Spells learned in this way do not require
                    days of study as with captured books and scrolls since they represent the culmination of prior days
                    of study.

                  <p>
                    Magic-Users may also accrue new spells by studying captured spell books or spell scrolls. Acquiring
                    new spells in this way requires time to study the material in question. The Magic-User will need to
                    spend 1 day per spell level to complete their study and fully integrate the knowledge. Scrolls used
                    in this way are consumed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Only the most exceptional Magic-Users are able to learn every spell. Use the following chart to
                    determine if you can know a spell.

                    Increases (or unfortunate decreases) to intelligence will allow or compel future re-rolls.
                    Magic-Users may cast spells from scrolls even if they&rsquo;re not able to learn the spell.

                    <strong>Potions and Scrolls</strong> When the Magic-User reaches 7th level they may begin to brew
                    potions and scribe scrolls. The brewing of potions requires time, space and an extensive laboratory
                    not to mention exotic components. Potions of Storm Giant Strength don&rsquo;t, as they say, grow on
                    trees. The creation of scrolls requires time, the material components of the spell to be scribed and
                    fine parchments and inks.

                    Thief characters have 7 skills that represent various aspects of their trade. The back-stab skill
                    increases at the rate indicated in the above table while the remaining 6 skills are increased by the
                    player. At first level the thief character starts with 60 points to distribute among their remaining
                    6 skills, no more than 30 points may be added to a single skill. Thief characters gain an additional
                    22 points per level starting at level 2 and ending at level 20. The player may not assign any more
                    than 11 points to any one skill at each of these levels. No skill may ever exceed 99%.

                  <p>
                    <strong>Pick Pockets</strong> is the skill used to lift (or plant) small personal items from
                    unsuspecting marks. The Thief may access pouches, pockets or even loose jewelry but may not obtain a
                    stowed item. If the thief fails their roll by more than 20% they&rsquo;ll be noticed by their target
                    or one of his allies.

                    <strong>Open Locks</strong> may be attempted by the thief but once per lock per level. Locks

                  <p>
                    Thieves may spend time inspecting a lock before attempting to pick it. If the thief spends 1 turn
                    inspecting a lock they may determine whether the lock is within their current skill and gain a 10%
                    bonus to their Open Locks roll. The thief gains a 5% for each additional turn spent inspecting the
                    lock to a maximum bonus of 20%. A thief may never have more than a 99% chance to succeed at opening
                    a lock.

                    <strong>Finding and Removing Traps</strong> are two related functions that need to be rolled
                    separately. Searching for a trap in this way requires the thief to spend 1 turn investigating the
                    area suspected of being trapped. This area may be no larger than 10 square feet per turn of
                    investigation. A failed find traps roll indicates the thief is satisfied no trap exists. Once a trap
                    is found the thief may roll to remove the trap.

                    Any clever adventurer may find a trap without the need to role. Some traps are far too dangerous to
                    disarm and should instead be thoughtfully avoided.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Move Silently</strong> you&rsquo;re quiet but not invisible. Clever use of terrain or
                    combining this skill others make it most effective. Success increases your chances to surprise
                    enemies by 1.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Hide In Shadows</strong> by remaining perfectly still the thief may conceal themselves in an
                    area of low light. Hide in Shadows never works if the thief is being directly observed and may be
                    defeated by light and certain types of spells or otherworldly vision. As with Move Silently, Hide in
                    Shadows increases your chances to surprise enemies by 1.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A Thief may either be moving or hiding but never both. The bonus to Surprise granted by Move
                    Silently and Hide in Shadows are never cumulative.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Climb Walls</strong> is used when the thief free climbs or when under fire. The first roll
                    is made when the thief has climbed half the intended distance. Failure indicates a set back of some
                    kind. Failure by more than 20% indicates the thief falls and takes 1d6 damage per 10 feet fallen.
                    Further rolls will be required to complete the climb.

          <h3 id="anchor-combat">Combat</h3>

          <p>
            Combat may begin in many ways but most commonly it begins when hostile forces meet in the field, when
            negotiation between two or more parties dissolves into violence, when one hostile force lays an ambush for
            another or, when two hostile forces stumble upon one another.
          </p>

          <h4 id="anchor-initiative">Initiative</h4>

          <div class="layout-2col">
            <p>
              When hostile forces meet in the field the players and monsters will roll initiative dice. The DM will roll
              one die for the monsters or may at his discretion roll 1 die for each monster group or significant
              monster. The character or monster with the highest roll starts combat. In the event that communication
              breaks down and combat erupts the first player or monster or monster group to break will go first. No
              initiative dice are rolled.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the first actor in the combat completes their turn that individual will call on the next actor in the
              combat and so on until each player and monster has taken their turn. The last actor in the current round
              will pick the first actor in the next round. If the monsters act last in a given round they&rsquo;ll
              always choose themselves to act first in the following round.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h4 id="anchor-surprise">Surprise</h4>

          <div class="layout-2col">
            <p>
              When hostile forces stumble upon each other they roll surprise dice. If one side succeeds while the other
              fails that side receives a surprise round. If both sides tie for failure or success, surprise is bypassed
              and initiative is rolled for as above. When one side lays an ambush for the other only the side laying in
              ambush rolls for surprise. If the ambushing side has plenty of time to prepare or is able to give
              themselves some other advantage they may gain surprise without needing to roll. A cautious group, alert to
              surprise may never be automatically surprised.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please note that surprise is indicated differently throughout the rules. Elves and Halflings for instance
              have a 4 in 6 chance to surprise enemies where Rangers may only be surprised on a 1 in 6. The DM will set
              the actual conditions of surprise at the time it occurs.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h4 id="anchor-weapons-and-spells">Weapons and Spells</h4>

          <div class="layout-2col">
            <p>
              Combat comes in three flavors, melee, missile and area of affect. Weapons are always swung, thrown or shot
              and classify as melee, missile or both in the case of thrown weapons. Spells may be melee (when the range
              is touch), missile if they affect a single target or area of effect when they affect all targets in an
              area.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a combatant is in melee range they may only use melee weapons, thrown missiles or cast spells with a
              range of self or touch. Melee is too dynamic for missile weapons or ranged spells to be deployed.
              Combatants who fire missiles or cast spells into a melee should do so with great caution for failure to
              hit your target means you may hit an ally. The DM will calculate this chance based on the circumstance and
              instruct the player to roll accordingly.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h4 id="anchor-cover-and-concealment">Cover and Concealment</h4>

          <div class="layout-2col">
            <p>
              When being fired upon by the enemy it makes sense to to take cover behind impermeable barriers such as

            <p>
              Cover is not a perfect defense. While projectiles of insufficient mass that must travel in a straight line
              may be blocked by cover it can&rsquo;t protect against spells that are able to bypass it (by exploding in
              the air above it for example) or missiles of sufficient mass to destroy it, such as a boulder hurled by a
              trebuchet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Concealment can take various forms. Dense fog may make it harder to spot a target but can&rsquo;t stop the
              flight path of a missile. A dense hedgerow may also block vision but allow some some missiles (such as
              arrows) through while others (a thrown axe) may become effectively entangled.
            </p>
            <p>Players and DMs should use their best judgment regarding cover and concealment.</p>

          <div class="layout-2col">
            <p>
              Time may be tracked in the game in different ways. Most often we track time using &ldquo;game time.&rdquo;
              Using game time we simply say that an amount of minutes, hours or days have passed and continue with the
              game. If the characters are making a simple safe journey lasting three days then three days for the
              characters may pass in the time it takes the DM to say, &ldquo;three days later.&rdquo; If the session
              needs to end when the characters are adventuring then game time might stand still until the start of the
              next session.
            </p>
            <p>
              Travel is not always safe. Sometimes the characters are passing through dangerous territory or may need to
              travel quickly. In cases where travel has some element of danger it may become an adventure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Players should remember that both allied and opposed factions are bound by the same time and physical laws
              as their characters. It&rsquo;s often desirable (or unavoidable) to use game time to say &ldquo;five weeks
              later&rdquo; but doing so allows game factions 5 weeks to advance their goals.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h4 id="anchor-exploration-time">Exploration Time</h4>

          <p>
            During exploration time passes using &ldquo;exploration time&rdquo;. Exploration time is a function of how
            much distance the characters can cover or what size area they can search in a given amount of time (see
            below). Generally speaking exploration time is divided into three paces slow, normal and fast where slow
            covers the least area with the most caution and fast the most area with the least caution.
          </p>

          <h4 id="anchor-dungeon-exploration">Dungeon Exploration</h4>

          <div class="layout-2col">
            <p>
              Dungeon exploration is measured in a unit of time called the &ldquo;Game Turn&rdquo; or simply turn. A
              turn equals 10 minutes. Please note the duration of most light sources is measured in turns. Characters
              may move through the dungeon at one of three paces slow, normal and fast. Movement is always assumed to
              occur at the pace of the slowest character, players may always indicate otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Slow.&nbsp;Characters move at 10&rsquo; x movement rate. When doing so they may detect approaching enemies
              before being detected themselves. Traps may be noticed without rolling and Find Traps rolls are done with
              a 20% bonus. Known traps are easily avoided.
            </p>
            <p>
              Normal.&nbsp;Characters move at 20&rsquo; x movement rate. When doing so normal rules for surprise apply.
              Traps may only be noticed by rolling Find Traps. Known traps may or may not be stumbled over depending on
              their nature and prior precautions. For example a clearly indicated pressure plate in a wide hallway may
              be avoided while a trip wire that must be stepped over would require a check to see if a character makes a
              mis-step.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast.&nbsp;Characters move at 30&rsquo; x movement rate. When doing so characters will always be surprised
              by enemies. Traps may only be noticed by rolling Find Traps and this check is made with a 20% penalty.
              Characters have a chance to stumble over known traps no matter what precautions have been taken.
            </p>
            <p>
              Monsters are subject to the same rules of movement. Their pace may modify the above rules. Generally
              speaking parties moving at a slower pace have an advantage over those moving at a faster pace while
              parties moving at the same pace cancel advantages.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any party moving through its home is considered to have the &ldquo;home court&rdquo; advantage. This party
              is considered to be moving one pace slower to reflect this advantage.

              While these environments may be traversed at various rates (see Dungeon Exploration above) those rates can
              be affected by vehicles, mounts, magic and possibly equipment. Given that complexity the DM will fill in

              Searching a league of wilderness costs an amount of time equal to the time it takes to traverse that

              There will be times during the course of play that will naturally lead to the characters needing to take a
              break from adventuring. Spell casters need time to learn new spells and any character may need to take
              rest to recover from grievous wounds. The players may also decide that their characters simply wish to
              take some time off from questing in order to spend more time with their treasure.
            </p>
            <p>
              No matter the case this is a time for the players to consider what their characters may wish to achieve
              outside of the adventure. A Thief may wish to find a fence, a Knight may search for a squire and the
              Fighter may simply wish to imbibe and be merry. A character may even wish to hire a group of adventurers
              to send off to achieve some goal the player characters don&rsquo;t have time to address.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any character may achieve or make progress toward achieving any goal by communicating it with the DM.
              Simple goals may need no more investment than the mere statement of intent while others may require
              additional in-game interactions to be carried out by the player and DM individually.
