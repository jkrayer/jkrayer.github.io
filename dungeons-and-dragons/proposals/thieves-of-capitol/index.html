          500 years before the war with the Elves, during the reign of Emperor Leto, the Undying, a group of thieves
          tries to make a name for themselves in the bustling streets of Capitol<sup
            ><a href="#anchor-footnote-001">1</a></sup
          >. In this first chapter, the player's fledgling crew will become embroiled in a murder plot that they must
          resolve to survive.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h2>Abstract</h2>

          <p>
            <strong>Structure:</strong> At the end of each adventure the players will be presented with two
            <a href="#anchor-jobs">jobs</a><sup><a href="#anchor-footnote-002">2</a></sup> and must select one. The DM
            will prepare that job for the following session. All <a href="#anchor-jobs">jobs</a
            ><sup><a href="#anchor-footnote-002">2</a></sup> will be offered by the patron of the crew, Joey
            Silver-Thumbs.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Sessions:</strong> 5 - 7. I will do my best to keep each session to a single evening's play.</p>

          <p>
            <strong>Session 0:</strong> Characters will be created, questions answered, and the first two
            <a href="#anchor-jobs">jobs</a><sup><a href="#anchor-footnote-002">2</a></sup> presented.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Pregenerated Characters:</strong> <a href="#anchor-pre-generated-characters">See Below</a></p>
          <p>
            <strong>Experience:</strong> Special rules for awarding experience to emphasize mission and objective
            completion over combat.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Special Equipment:</strong> Sap. A successful back-stab attack made with a sap renders the target
            unconscious. The target must have hit dice less than or equal to the wielder's back-stab multiplier, be a
            medium-sized or smaller humanoid, and must not be wearing metal armor. The target is rendered unconscious
            for 1d4 + back-stab multiplier rounds, 1d4 + 2 for a first-level Thief. A natural 20 doubles the duration.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Reputation:</strong> Reputation with other factions starts at 0 (unknown) and may be adjusted up or
            down by 1-2 points after each mission.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Conclusion:</strong> At the end of this Chapter a second chapter or new campaign may be proposed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Play test:</strong> The Assassin, Bard and adjustments to the Fighter and Thief abilities will be
            tested for balance and fun.

          <h2>Capitol During the Reign of Emperor Leto, the Undying</h2>

          <p>
            The Empire's expansion has slowed to a crawl as Leto redirects his armies from conquest to exploration.
            Officially Leto reigns over a golden age of peace but his unnatural longevity breeds suspicion and rumors of
            dark pacts. His generals compete to find the key to immortality instead of increasing the Empire's borders
            and wealth.
          </p>
          <p>
            At home Leto's entertainments become increasingly extravagant, distracting the populace from the Empire's
            stagnation. With the slowing of new wealth flowing into the city, crime is on the rise as factions vie for
            control of the underworld.
          </p>

          <section>
            <h3>Military</h3>

            <p>
              The Imperial Guard is the only professional Military force permitted within the city. By law they're also
              the only citizens allowed to bear arms or wear armor within city limits. The Imperial Guard is primarily
              concerned with the external security of the city and that of the Emperor. They do not enforce laws or turn
              their gaze inward unless the security of the Emperor is threatened. They may be called upon to assist the
              City Watch in times of great need. At these times the wise clear the streets. The Guard are elite
              soldiers, they deal in blood.
            </p>

            <p>
              Traditionally the Imperial Guard numbers 500. This number is not enshrined in law and may fluctuate
              depending upon the current Emperor or when war comes to the homelands. Under Leto the Guard numbers 1,000.
            </p>

            <p>
              The City Watch tends to the enforcement of laws. They're armed with truncheons and whistles and bear
              lanterns at night. Some patrols are accompanied by a Priest of Themis. These priests are responsible for
              all trials and judgments.
            </p>

            <p>
              The wealthy are often escorted by a retinue of guards to ensure their safety. Those who are able may
              employ private security. Strictly speaking the laws for private security are the same as for average
              citizens which is to say the are forbidden from carrying weapons or wearing armor.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h3>Laws you Should Know</h3>

            <p>The Imperial Guard is the only military force allowed within the city limits.</p>

            <p>
              The bearing of arms and armor within the city limits is strictly forbidden to all but the Imperial Guard.
            </p>

            <p>The City Watch may bear the truncheon and no other weapon.</p>

            <p>
              Anyone caught in possession of mechanical means of hurling missiles (slings, bows, crossbows, and so
              forth) or the ammunition for such weapons within the city limits is subject to summary execution except in
              times of siege.
            </p>

            <p>The wearing of armor or carrying of weapons is punishable by confiscation and public flogging.</p>

            <p>
              Brandishing a weapon in public is punished by removal of the left thumb for the first offense and the
              right for the second. If a third offense is somehow committed, the offender will be executed. If, in the
              course of brandishing a weapon, someone is injured or killed, the offender will additionally be fined an
              amount deemed appropriate by the Temple of Themis.
            </p>

            <p>
              Assault, dismemberment and murder are punishable by fines in addition to applicable penalties for other
              laws broken in the commission of the primary crime.
            </p>

            <p>All Magic-Users must register with The Imperial College of Arcane Mysteries.</p>

            <p>
              Destruction of property by mundane or magical means is punishable by fines to equal the value of the
              property destroyed plus reasonable restitution for labor lost. Repeat offenders may face harsher
              penalties.
            </p>

            <p>
              The misuse of fire, especially magical fire, is punishable by fine then death by burning at the stake.
            </p>

            <p>
              Theft by deception, force or otherwise is punishable by loss of a finger and a fine to total the value of
              the amount of property lost plus any additional damages deemed appropriate by the Temple of Themis.
            </p>

            <p>
              In all cases where a fine cannot be paid in full, the accused will be indentured for a period not to
              exceed the repayment of the fine in full plus reasonable personal maintenance of the accused.
            </p>
            <h4>Practical Considerations</h4>

            <p>
              Though the laws are strict, enforcement can be inconsistent. Bribes and corruption are not uncommon, and
              those with wealth or influence may find ways to circumvent the rules.
            </p>

            <p>
              The society in which the game takes place is quasi-medieval. There's no CSI, and eye-witnesses receive a
              level of trust in accordance with their standing in the community.
            </p>

            <p>
              Society takes a dim view of aggressors. If, for example, a Butcher hacks the hand off a cut-purse, bearing
              in mind the Butcher technically shouldn't be carrying his cleaver, the guard is likely to consider the
              matter resolved and send both parties on their way.

          <h2>Jobs</h2>

          <p>
            Your underworld contact, Joey Silver Thumbs, has a steady supply of work. At the end of every session he'll
            offer you two jobs<sup><a href="#anchor-footnote-002">2</a></sup
            >. The one you accept will be the one I prepare and the adventure for the next session. For each job you'll
            be given an objective, pay, time frame and location. Most employers wish to remain anonymous and there's
            always someone who stands to lose and will therefore work to thwart your efforts.
          </p>

          <p>Jobs will be presented as prompts.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              There's a Cult of Demon worshippers planning a major ritual that could have catastrophic consequences.
              Their temple is in sewers. Recover their unholy relic and leave no survivors. It pays 240gp and I need it
              done by dawn.
            </li>

            <li>
              The Veiled are smuggling a powerful artifact through the city. Intercept the shipment at their warehouse,
              retrieve the artifact before it reaches its destination. It pays 100gp and I need it done within 72 hours.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>The players should carefully consider the risks and rewards of each in job before making a decision.</p>

          <p>
            Job 1: Cult of Demon Worshippers has a tight deadline; the characters risk punishment while transporting
            their weapons and armor and, of course, their lives in combat. Their reputation as an adversary of cults
            will grow, setting unknown forces against them. On the other hand, the destruction of the cult will most
            likely increase their positive reputation with the Clergy and certainly with the Sewer Rats since they take
            a dim view of trespassers in "their" sewers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Job 2: The Veiled are smuggling a powerful artifact through the city. Though the reward in gold is lower,
            this job gives the characters ample time to plan and therefore bears less risk to execute. However, the
            characters risk exposure to the Veiled perhaps before they're ready to handle the inevitable consequences.
            The Veiled have many enemies, so successfully retrieving the artifact could greatly enhance the crew's
            standing in the underworld.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each of these jobs<sup><a href="#anchor-footnote-002">2</a></sup> also has an experience reward associated
            with it that will be unknown until the job is completed. This reward is in addition to standard D&D
            experience for defeating monsters and recovering treasure. Generally, the more difficult the job, the
            greater the experience reward. Jobs that have special conditions such as "leave no survivors" act as a
            multiplier to the base reward if they are achieved.
          </p>

          <p>
            While the final math is likely to change based on the number of players and current party level, it would
            work something like this: If job 1 is worth 300 experience points and the party successfully "leaves no
            survivors," they would receive 600 experience points for completing the job—300 for recovering the unholy
            relic and 300 for leaving no survivors. Job 2, being far less risky and having no bonus objectives, might
            only be worth 100 experience points total.
          </p>

              <sup>*</sup>The Gnomish people are indentured to the Empire for 1,000 years in return for their liberation
              from the Giants. Due to this fact Gnomes outside of their homelands masquerade as Halflings. The Halfling
              people typically aid Gnomes in that effort.

          My calling the capitol city of the empire "Capitol" is not meant in any way to copy the work of
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mcolville" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Colville</a>. I am a fan but I use

          too.
