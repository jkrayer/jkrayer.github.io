# Scrap Lore of Capitol

          <p style="text-decoration: line-through">
            The Empire, sometimes called the Empire of Man, is decidedly but not solely human. In descending order
            Halflings, Dwarves and Gnomes may be found in Capitol.
          </p>

          <p style="text-decoration: line-through">
            Halflings have been part of the Empire for as long as anyone can remember. These mostly pastoral folk are
            lionized for their agricultural skills. The surplus created by their industry feeds the Empire. Halflings in
            the city are mostly good folk but a few take advantage of their child-like appearance for selfish ends.

            Dwarves are the only race known to have fought in the Imperial Legions to a standstill. They are respected
            for their martial prowess and their skill in crafting weapons and armor. Many Dwarves serve as mercenaries
            or bodyguards in the city.

            Officially the Empire discovered the Dwarven people at the end of their wars against the Giants and seeing
            their potential for craftsmanship and combat, accepted the Dwarven kingdoms as vassal states. This is not
            the story Dwarves teach their children.
          </p>

          <p style="text-decoration: line-through">
            The Gnomish people were enslaved by the Giants who forced them to mine precious minerals and gems. The
            Empire "liberated" them during the war. The Empire teaches that their discovery of the Gnomish people was a
            benevolent act, but in truth, it was a means to exploit their talents.
          </p>

          <p style="text-decoration: line-through">
            During the war with the Giants the Empire discovered the Gnomish people and their unique talents for
            invention and engineering.
          </p>

          <p style="text-decoration: line-through">
            Leto's reign takes place before the Northward expansion of the Empire some 500 years before the war with the
            Elves. At this time the average citizen has never heard of Elves unless much less seen one. Tall tales of
            such folk sometimes return with soldiers but these are sparse and often dismissed as fantasy. As such Elves
            and Half-Elves are not permitted in this campaign.

          I quite liked &ldquo;Chapter 1: A World of your Own&rdquo; from the 5E Dungeon Master's Guide. I found myself
          particularly influenced by the "Gods of your World" section due to my dislike of the samey feel of standard
          D&D pantheons, or as I've heard them called, (the source escapes me) micro-monotheisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Gods of The Empire, which is as of now still unnamed, are in the parlance of the 5E Dungeons Master's
          Guide a "tight pantheon." For various reasons they are based on the Greek Titans but may of course evolve over
          time.
