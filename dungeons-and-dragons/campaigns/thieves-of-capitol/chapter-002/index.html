        <h2>Capitol During the Reign of Emperor Leto, the Undying</h2>

        <p>
          The Empire's expansion has slowed to a crawl as Leto redirects his armies from conquest to exploration.
          Officially Leto reigns over a golden age of peace but his unnatural longevity breeds suspicion and rumors of
          dark pacts. His generals compete to find the key to immortality instead of increasing the Empire's borders and
          wealth.
        </p>

        <p>
          At home Leto's entertainments become increasingly extravagant, distracting the populace from the Empire's
          stagnation. With the slowing of new wealth flowing into the city, crime is on the rise as factions vie for
          control of the underworld.
        </p>

        <h3>Military</h3>

        <p>
          The Imperial Guard is the only professional Military force permitted within the city. By law they're also the
          only citizens allowed to bear arms or wear armor within city limits. The Imperial Guard is primarily concerned
          with the external security of the city and that of the Emperor. They do not enforce laws or turn their gaze
          inward unless the security of the Emperor is threatened. They may be called upon to assist the City Watch in
          times of great need. At these times the wise clear the streets. The Guard are elite soldiers, they deal in
          blood.
        </p>

        <p>
          Traditionally the Imperial Guard numbers 500. This number is not enshrined in law and may fluctuate depending
          upon the current Emperor or when war comes to the homelands. Under Leto the Guard numbers 1,000.
        </p>

        <p>
          The City Watch tends to the enforcement of laws. They're armed with truncheons and whistles and bear lanterns
          at night. Some patrols are accompanied by a Priest of Themis. These priests are responsible for all trials and
          judgments.
        </p>

        <p>
          The wealthy are often escorted by a retinue of guards to ensure their safety. Those who are able may employ
          private security. Strictly speaking the laws for private security are the same as for average citizens which
          is to say the are forbidden from carrying weapons or wearing armor.
        </p>

        <h3>Laws you Should Know</h3>

        <p>The Imperial Guard is the only military force allowed within the city limits.</p>

        <p>The bearing of arms and armor within the city limits is strictly forbidden to all but the Imperial Guard.</p>

        <p>The City Watch may bear the truncheon and no other weapon.</p>

        <p>
          Anyone caught in possession of mechanical means of hurling missiles (slings, bows, crossbows, and so forth) or
          the ammunition for such weapons within the city limits is subject to summary execution except in times of
          siege.
        </p>

        <p>The wearing of armor or carrying of weapons is punishable by confiscation and public flogging.</p>

        <p>
          Brandishing a weapon in public is punished by removal of the left thumb for the first offense and the right
          for the second. If a third offense is somehow committed, the offender will be executed. If, in the course of
          brandishing a weapon, someone is injured or killed, the offender will additionally be fined an amount deemed
          appropriate by the Temple of Themis.
        </p>

        <p>
          Assault, dismemberment and murder are punishable by fines in addition to applicable penalties for other laws
          broken in the commission of the primary crime.
        </p>

        <p>All Magic-Users must register with The Imperial College of Arcane Mysteries.</p>

        <p>
          Destruction of property by mundane or magical means is punishable by fines to equal the value of the property
          destroyed plus reasonable restitution for labor lost. Repeat offenders may face harsher penalties.
        </p>

        <p>The misuse of fire, especially magical fire, is punishable by fine then death by burning at the stake.</p>

        <p>
          Theft by deception, force or otherwise is punishable by loss of a finger and a fine to total the value of the
          amount of property lost plus any additional damages deemed appropriate by the Temple of Themis.
        </p>

        <p>
          In all cases where a fine cannot be paid in full, the accused will be indentured for a period not to exceed
          the repayment of the fine in full plus reasonable personal maintenance of the accused.
        </p>

        <h4>Practical Considerations</h4>

        <p>
          Though the laws are strict, enforcement can be inconsistent. Bribes and corruption are not uncommon, and those
          with wealth or influence may find ways to circumvent the rules.
        </p>

        <p>
          The society in which the game takes place is quasi-medieval. There's no CSI, and eye-witnesses receive a level
          of trust in accordance with their standing in the community.
        </p>

        <p>
          Society takes a dim view of aggressors. If, for example, a Butcher hacks the hand off a cut-purse, bearing in
          mind the Butcher technically shouldn't be carrying his cleaver, the guard is likely to consider the matter
          resolved and send both parties on their way.
        </p>

          <p>
            This table represents the direct affect of acting for or against a faction but not the additional positive
            or negative impact to your reputation with allied or enemy factions.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example. At the end of the last campaign the party was instrumental in the defeat of "The Vieled" and
            House Rosencrans. In doing so they directly helped both House Tantalas and House Valencia, indirectly helped
            or harmed others and shaped the opinion of even more remote parties.
          </p>

          <p>The resulting reputation adjustments are:</p>

          <table>

          <p>
            Most adventures won't have such far-reaching affects since they won't be as public but with Joey
            Silver-Thumbs gone the party will have less anonymity and more advanced knowledge about who they're helping
            and harming.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Jobs</h2>

        <p>
          <em class="changes"
            >Jobs will flow to the party from both the group's and the individuals's contacts. There will be 1-3 jobs
            available at any given time. Jobs will only become unavailable when their time frame runs out or when a
            rival npc crew completes it.</em
          >
          The players must accept one job at the end of each session, that job will be the adventure for the next
          session. For each job you'll be given an objective, pay, time frame, location
          <em class="changes">and an idea of how your actions will impact the part's reputation</em>.
        </p>

        <p>Jobs will be presented as prompts.</p>

        <p>
          There's a Cult of Demon worshippers planning a major ritual that could have catastrophic consequences. Their
          temple is in sewers. Recover their unholy relic and leave no survivors. It pays 240gp and I need it done by
          dawn.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Veiled are smuggling a powerful artifact through the city. Intercept the shipment at their warehouse,
          retrieve the artifact before it reaches its destination. It pays 100gp and I need it done within 72 hours. The
          players should carefully consider the risks and rewards of each in job before making a decision.
        </p>

        <p>
          Job 1: Cult of Demon Worshippers has a tight deadline; the characters risk punishment while transporting their
          weapons and armor and, of course, their lives in combat. Their reputation as an adversary of cults will grow,
          setting unknown forces against them. On the other hand, the destruction of the cult will most likely increase
          their positive reputation with the Clergy and certainly with the Sewer Rats since they take a dim view of
          trespassers in "their" sewers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Job 2: The Veiled are smuggling a powerful artifact through the city. Though the reward in gold is lower, this
          job gives the characters ample time to plan and therefore bears less risk to execute. However, the characters
          risk exposure to the Veiled perhaps before they're ready to handle the inevitable consequences. The Veiled
          have many enemies, so successfully retrieving the artifact could greatly enhance the crew's standing in the
          underworld.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each of these jobs2 also has an experience reward associated with it that will be unknown until the job is
          completed. This reward is in addition to standard D&D experience for defeating monsters and recovering
          treasure. Generally, the more difficult the job, the greater the experience reward. Jobs that have special
          conditions such as "leave no survivors" act as a multiplier to the base reward if they are achieved.
        </p>

        <p>
          While the final math is likely to change based on the number of players and current party level, it would work
          something like this: If job 1 is worth 300 experience points and the party successfully "leaves no survivors,"
          they would receive 600 experience points for completing the job—300 for recovering the unholy relic and 300
          for leaving no survivors. Job 2, being far less risky and having no bonus objectives, might only be worth 100
          experience points total.
        </p>

        <h2>Factions</h2>

        <p>
          The city is home to many factions, each with their own agendas and interests. This is a list of factions that
          may appear in Chapter 1.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="b">The Valencia</span>: Raymon Valencia was a successful foreign admiral before turning his
            skill at sea to trade. A recent transplant to Capitol, his defiance of the status quo annoys his rivals in
            trade and shipping.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="b">The Tantalas Family</span>: Christoph Tantalas' recent passing has left the family in a
            precarious position. His foppish son, Alexandar, struggles to maintain the family's legacy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="b">The River Vipers</span>: An upstart gang of thugs known for their brutality and
            military-like discipline.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="b">The Clergy</span>: A loose term for the various temples and priests that serve the pantheon.
            While all temples ultimately serve the pantheon each temple and its priesthood has different priorities and
            ambitions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="b">Wizards</span>: Members of The Imperial College of Arcane Mysteries. Highly secretive and
            even more dangerous no one knows if they pursue their own agendas or the interests of the college. What's
            certain is their pursuit of power.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="b">Nimblefingers</span>: Exclusively Halfling pickpockets that work the market squares and
            visitors quarters.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="b">Demon Cults</span>: Generic name for myriad groups that secretly worship malevolent
            entities.
          </li>
          <li><span class="b">Dock Street Buys</span>: Thugs and ruffians who zealously guard the porters trade.</li>
          <li>
            <span class="b">The Sewer Rats</span>: A pejorative term for the members of the Sanitation Guild. They're
            all but invisible to most of Capitol's1 society, but it's a commonly known secret in the underworld that
            they can take you anywhere in the city for a price.

              This dwarf has come to Capitol to kill humans. It's not necessary to play this character as a psychopath
              but, when given a choice between fighting humans and anything else this character will suggest fighting.
              After a fight involving humans is joined this dwarf won't retreat or stop unless retrained by allies.

            <p>
              This dwarf was a part of a unit of giant killers dispatched to train human forces during their war with
              the giants. That unit was betrayed by the human General Androbulos during the Battle of Boulder Pass. Few
              dwarves managed to survive and a truce was eventually sealed by Androbulos blood. This dwarf has not
              forgotten.

              This human was the only full-time thief in his crew and so joining another crew was the only option after
              Joey was killed. He's still panged by occasional guilt over abandoning his former crew and will suggest
              one or more of them any time this crew required assistance.

              This dwarf is a member of the Duersguild which isn't really a secret since the Guild and the Priesthood

              spy on them in order to learn how they bypassed a Duersgate. That tale has been told and satisfied that
              the fault was with human masonry your mission is done leaving you free to join the party.

            My calling the capitol city of the empire "Capitol" is not meant in any way to copy the work of Matt
            Colville. I am a fan but I use "Capitol" herein because I can't think of a better name. I reserve the right
            to rename the capitol city in the future.
          </p>

          <p>
            It would be an understatement to say that this game is heavily based on the "Reviled Society" concept
            created by Professor Dungeon Master of the Dungeon Craft YouTube channel. While I hope to grow this initial
            game beyond that framework I just loved it so much that I wanted to do it too.
