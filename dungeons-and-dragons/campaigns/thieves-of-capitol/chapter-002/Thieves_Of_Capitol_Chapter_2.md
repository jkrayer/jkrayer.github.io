# Proposal: Thieves of Capitol Chapter 2

_An amount of_ years before the war with the Elves, during the reign of Emperor Leto, the Undying, a group of thieves tries to make a name for themselves in the bustling streets of Capitol. _In this second chapter, the player's fledgling crew, "The Baker's Dozen," expands and establishes themselves as independent actors._

_After the loss of their patron, Joey Silver-Thumbs, and the flight of their friend Shel, "The Bakers Dozen," rebuilds their crew and forges a network of their own._

## Abstract

**Structure:** At the end of each adventure the players will be presented with _one or more jobs_ and must select one. The selected job will be the adventure for the following session. _The Baker's Dozen will receive jobs from various contacts they make during the game._

**Sessions:** _?. In this chapter the crew will establish their place in the underworld and develop their own network of contacts. The players will determine when that objective is satisfactorily achieved._

**Session 0-ish:** Characters will be created, questions answered, and the first jobs presented.

**Pregenerated Characters:** To Come

**Experience:** Special rules for awarding experience to emphasize mission and objective completion over combat.

**Special Equipment:** Sap. A successful back-stab attack made with a sap renders the target unconscious. The target must have hit dice less than or equal to the wielder's back-stab multiplier, be a medium-sized or smaller humanoid, and must not be wearing metal armor. The target is rendered unconscious for 1d4 + back-stab multiplier rounds, 1d4 + 2 for a first-level Thief. A natural 20 doubles the duration.

**Reputation:** Reputation with other factions starts at 0 (unknown) and may be adjusted up or down after each mission. _Expanded details below._

## Capitol During the Reign of Emperor Leto, the Undying

The Empire's expansion has slowed to a crawl as Leto redirects his armies from conquest to exploration. Officially Leto reigns over a golden age of peace but his unnatural longevity breeds suspicion and rumors of dark pacts. His generals compete to find the key to immortality instead of increasing the Empire's borders and wealth.

At home Leto's entertainments become increasingly extravagant, distracting the populace from the Empire's stagnation. With the slowing of new wealth flowing into the city, crime is on the rise as factions vie for control of the underworld.

### Military

The Imperial Guard is the only professional Military force permitted within the city. By law they're also the only citizens allowed to bear arms or wear armor within city limits. The Imperial Guard is primarily concerned with the external security of the city and that of the Emperor. They do not enforce laws or turn their gaze inward unless the security of the Emperor is threatened. They may be called upon to assist the City Watch in times of great need. At these times the wise clear the streets. The Guard are elite soldiers, they deal in blood.

Traditionally the Imperial Guard numbers 500. This number is not enshrined in law and may fluctuate depending upon the current Emperor or when war comes to the homelands. Under Leto the Guard numbers 1,000.

The City Watch tends to the enforcement of laws. They're armed with truncheons and whistles and bear lanterns at night. Some patrols are accompanied by a Priest of Themis. These priests are responsible for all trials and judgments.

The wealthy are often escorted by a retinue of guards to ensure their safety. Those who are able may employ private security. Strictly speaking the laws for private security are the same as for average citizens which is to say the are forbidden from carrying weapons or wearing armor.

### Laws you Should Know

The Imperial Guard is the only military force allowed within the city limits.

The bearing of arms and armor within the city limits is strictly forbidden to all but the Imperial Guard.

The City Watch may bear the truncheon and no other weapon.

Anyone caught in possession of mechanical means of hurling missiles (slings, bows, crossbows, and so forth) or the ammunition for such weapons within the city limits is subject to summary execution except in times of siege.

The wearing of armor or carrying of weapons is punishable by confiscation and public flogging.

Brandishing a weapon in public is punished by removal of the left thumb for the first offense and the right for the second. If a third offense is somehow committed, the offender will be executed. If, in the course of brandishing a weapon, someone is injured or killed, the offender will additionally be fined an amount deemed appropriate by the Temple of Themis.

Assault, dismemberment and murder are punishable by fines in addition to applicable penalties for other laws broken in the commission of the primary crime.

All Magic-Users must register with The Imperial College of Arcane Mysteries.

Destruction of property by mundane or magical means is punishable by fines to equal the value of the property destroyed plus reasonable restitution for labor lost. Repeat offenders may face harsher penalties.

The misuse of fire, especially magical fire, is punishable by fine then death by burning at the stake.

Theft by deception, force or otherwise is punishable by loss of a finger and a fine to total the value of the amount of property lost plus any additional damages deemed appropriate by the Temple of Themis.

In all cases where a fine cannot be paid in full, the accused will be indentured for a period not to exceed the repayment of the fine in full plus reasonable personal maintenance of the accused.

### Practical Considerations

Though the laws are strict, enforcement can be inconsistent. Bribes and corruption are not uncommon, and those with wealth or influence may find ways to circumvent the rules.

The society in which the game takes place is quasi-medieval. There's no CSI, and eye-witnesses receive a level of trust in accordance with their standing in the community.

Society takes a dim view of aggressors. If, for example, a Butcher hacks the hand off a cut-purse, bearing in mind the Butcher technically shouldn't be carrying his cleaver, the guard is likely to consider the matter resolved and send both parties on their way.

## Reputation

Reputation is awarded in prime numbers from 1-11 approximately as follows.

| Points (+/-) | Meaning                                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1            | minor harm or help; identity of perpetrator uncertain |
| 2            | minor harm or help; identity of perpetrator certain   |
| 3            | harm or help; identity of perpetrator uncertain       |
| 5            | harm or help; identity of perpetrator certain         |
| 7            | Major harm or help; identity of perpetrator uncertain |
| 11           | Major harm or help; identity of perpetrator certain   |

This table represents the direct affect of acting for or against a faction but not the additional positive or negative impact to your reputation with allied or enemy factions.

For example. At the end of the last campaign the party was instrumental in the defeat of "The Vieled" and House Rosencrans. In doing so they directly helped both House Tantalas and House Valencia, indirectly helped or harmed others and shaped the opinion of even more remote parties.

The resulting reputation adjustments are:

| Points | Faction                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| -11    | The Veiled, House Rosencrans   |
| +11    | House Tantalas                 |
| +5     | House Valencia                 |
| -3     | Criminals (gangs, cults)       |
| +1     | Authorities (guard, the faith) |

Most adventures won't have such far-reaching affects since they won't be as public but with Joey Silver-Thumbs gone the party will have less anonymity and more advanced knowledge about who they're helping and harming.

## Jobs

_Jobs will flow to the party from both the group's and the individuals's contacts. There will be 1-3 jobs available at any given time. Jobs will only become unavailable when their time frame runs out or when a rival npc crew completes it._ The players must accept one job at the end of each session, that job will be the adventure for the next session. For each job you'll be given an objective, pay, time frame, location _and an idea of how your actions will impact the part's reputation_.

Jobs will be presented as prompts.

There's a Cult of Demon worshippers planning a major ritual that could have catastrophic consequences. Their temple is in sewers. Recover their unholy relic and leave no survivors. It pays 240gp and I need it done by dawn.

The Veiled are smuggling a powerful artifact through the city. Intercept the shipment at their warehouse, retrieve the artifact before it reaches its destination. It pays 100gp and I need it done within 72 hours.
The players should carefully consider the risks and rewards of each in job before making a decision.

Job 1: Cult of Demon Worshippers has a tight deadline; the characters risk punishment while transporting their weapons and armor and, of course, their lives in combat. Their reputation as an adversary of cults will grow, setting unknown forces against them. On the other hand, the destruction of the cult will most likely increase their positive reputation with the Clergy and certainly with the Sewer Rats since they take a dim view of trespassers in "their" sewers.

Job 2: The Veiled are smuggling a powerful artifact through the city. Though the reward in gold is lower, this job gives the characters ample time to plan and therefore bears less risk to execute. However, the characters risk exposure to the Veiled perhaps before they're ready to handle the inevitable consequences. The Veiled have many enemies, so successfully retrieving the artifact could greatly enhance the crew's standing in the underworld.

Each of these jobs2 also has an experience reward associated with it that will be unknown until the job is completed. This reward is in addition to standard D&D experience for defeating monsters and recovering treasure. Generally, the more difficult the job, the greater the experience reward. Jobs that have special conditions such as "leave no survivors" act as a multiplier to the base reward if they are achieved.

While the final math is likely to change based on the number of players and current party level, it would work something like this: If job 1 is worth 300 experience points and the party successfully "leaves no survivors," they would receive 600 experience points for completing the job—300 for recovering the unholy relic and 300 for leaving no survivors. Job 2, being far less risky and having no bonus objectives, might only be worth 100 experience points total.

## Factions

The city is home to many factions, each with their own agendas and interests. This is a list of factions that may appear in Chapter 1.

- **The Valencia**: Raymon Valencia was a successful foreign admiral before turning his skill at sea to trade. A recent transplant to Capitol, his defiance of the status quo annoys his rivals in trade and shipping.
- **The Tantalas Family**: Christoph Tantalas' recent passing has left the family in a precarious position. His foppish son, Alexandar, struggles to maintain the family's legacy.
- **The River Vipers**: An upstart gang of thugs known for their brutality and military-like discipline.
- **The Clergy**: A loose term for the various temples and priests that serve the pantheon. While all temples ultimately serve the pantheon each temple and its priesthood has different priorities and ambitions.
- **Wizards**: Members of The Imperial College of Arcane Mysteries. Highly secretive and even more dangerous no one knows if they pursue their own agendas or the interests of the college. What's certain is their pursuit of power.
- **Nimblefingers**: Exclusively Halfling pickpockets that work the market squares and visitors quarters.
- **Demon Cults**: Generic name for myriad groups that secretly worship malevolent entities.
- **Dock Street Buys**: Thugs and ruffians who zealously guard the porters trade.
- **The Sewer Rats**: A pejorative term for the members of the Sanitation Guild. They're all but invisible to most of Capitol's1 society, but it's a commonly known secret in the underworld that they can take you anywhere in the city for a price.

## Footnotes

My calling the capitol city of the empire "Capitol" is not meant in any way to copy the work of Matt Colville. I am a fan but I use "Capitol" herein because I can't think of a better name. I reserve the right to rename the capitol city in the future.

It would be an understatement to say that this game is heavily based on the "Reviled Society" concept created by Professor Dungeon Master of the Dungeon Craft YouTube channel. While I hope to grow this initial game beyond that framework I just loved it so much that I wanted to do it too.
