        </hgroup>

        <h3>Epilogue</h3>

        <p>
          By now the word is out. Some group of fools tried to steal "The Hammer of Mord" and were killed to a man. The
          Dwarves are moving it early and the guard is cracking skulls. Smart crews are laying low.
        </p>

        <p>
          You failed to steal the stone box and left witnesses behind. After a severe dressing down from Joey and
          cooling off period the crew gathers at The Crooked Hook once again.

            &ldquo;Word on the street is the Vieled need some quick cash,&rdquo; Joey says while rapping his silver
            thumb on the table.

          <p>
            &ldquo;They're selling some arcane book to a wizard, I don't know which, wizard not book and before you ask
            I don't know that neither.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>&ldquo;The exchange goes down tonight at &lsquo;The Pickled Apis&rsquo; Mead Hall.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Expect both parties to be heavily guarded and the Hall to be watched.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;Get it done and there's 190 gold in it for each of you.&rdquo;</p>

        <h3>The Crooked Hook</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            The Crooked Hook is a narrow alley of a dive wedged between two tenements on Hook Street. It's the kind of
            invisible neighborhood place you'd miss if you blinked, and based on the scarcity of patrons, you'd guess
            most people do.
          </p>

          <p>
            The swing of the creaking front door interrupts a small ship's bell hung for the purpose of alerting the
            owner to the presence of new patrons. The walls of the Hook are crowded with memorabilia from the river
            fishing trade that once dominated Capitol. The floors are choked with worn furniture in need of repair. From
            the rude condition of the interior, one might expect the appearance of patrons to be welcome—but Dodgy Pat
            never fails to look dismayed at new arrivals.
          </p>

          <p>
            The musty perfume of stale beer and ancient timber hangs in the air as you cross the creaking floor to the
            bar. The ever-present Old Jim, as battered as the stool upon which he sits, sips his ale and bobs as you
            pass—but whether it's in greeting or inebriation, you've never been sure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite your effort to become trusted here, Pat works deliberately at polishing the glassware as if you're
            invisible. Each order placed is answered with a curt nod and the feeling you're aggravating Pat with your
            insistence that he ply his trade as barman. Each order is filled with a deliberately pulled pint of Hook
            Ale, despite what you may have asked for.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's in the back corner of this cramped hall that Joey Silver-Thumbs holds court over his crews. Few dare
            glance for more than a moment at his mutilated hands, and no one dares to ask after the cause—but in
            Capitol, there's only one sure way to lose two thumbs. Joey's temper tells the rest of the story.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite his occasional bouts of explosive anger, Joey is downright kind as long as his crews follow two
            rules. First: "Make up your damn minds." Joey has no patience for lollygagging. Second: "The best crew gets
            the best jobs." Simple as that. He defines the best crew as the one who succeeds the most while being the
            least pain in his ass.
          </p>
          <p>Tonight Joey has a job—your first job. "Handle this for me, and there's more and better in the future."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>First Job</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            &ldquo;Alright ya mooks I got two things need doing.&rdquo; Joey pauses to make sure you're listening
            instead of day dreaming.
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;I got word the Ronsencrans are moving cargo into one of their warehouses tonight after dark,&rdquo;
            he pauses meaningfully.
          </p>

          <p>
            &ldquo;I've a buyer lined up for a stone box in the freight and I need youse to liberate said item.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>&ldquo;They'll move it in the morning so It's gotta be done by dawn.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;And it has to be done one the Q.T. or the deals off and no one gets paid,&rdquo; Joey pauses for that
            fact to sink in.
          </p>
          <p>&ldquo;There's 100 gold in it for each of you and remember, no witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>&ldquo;The Great Vault of the Empire is hosting the, 'Heroes of the Jotun Conquest' exhibit.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;Among the items being shown is 'The Hammer of Mord', Mord as you know is the father of the dwarven
            gods.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;I've got a buyer who wants it but you've got to get it done before the dwarves move the hammer,
            you've got 72 hours before the exhibit moves on.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>&ldquo;The dwarves have it under armed guard 24/7 by special permission of Emperor Leto himself.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;And don't mistake em by their size, the dwarves are well armed and armored and tough as mithril
            nails.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>&ldquo;But you get this one done and you'll be legends,&rdquo; he says beaming.</p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;There's a 200 gold pay day in it for each of you but you've got to be like the wind on this
            one.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>&ldquo;No bodies, no witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
        </blockquote>
