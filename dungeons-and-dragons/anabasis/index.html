        <h2 class="header-anchor" id="anchor-introduction"><a href="#anchor-introduction">Introduction</a></h2>

        <p>After defeat in Harkenwald your unit flees South through the Barony of Therund. If you can make the Iron Ring redoubt in Moonstair you'll find shelter and passage out of the gods forsaken North.</p>
        
        <p>Through hostile territory. No food. No friends. Few coins.</p>

        <h2 class="header-anchor" id="anchor-dnd"><a href="#anchor-dnd">Primer</a></h2>

        <p>This game will be ran using the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons rules published by TSR. No worries if you've never played AD&D we'll all learn along the way.</p>
        
        <p>At its simplest TSR-era D&D's primary difference to modern D&D is that player skill trumps dice rolling. There's no need to roll to search a desk when you can describe your character's search. There's no need for the DM to conceal a clue in the desk because of a bad roll. The act of searching the desk is enough to find its contents. There are three main differences to consider.</p> 

        <h4>Role-Playing</h4>

        <p>The true essence of Role-Play is not the ability to speak extemporaneously in character. It is the ability to think about the game world as a world much like or own and to describe the actions we'd like our characters to take in it.</p> 

        <h4>The Dice are the Enemy</h4>

        <p>Dice represent the possibility of failure. Sometimes they're unavoidable. Investigate the world around you. Craft thoughful solutions. Don't let the dice snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.</p>

        <h4>Combat is Deadly</h4>

        <p>Combat should occur only when other means have failed. Gather intelligence. Leverage surprise. Stack the odds in your favor. Never engage in a fair fight. Your foes won't.</p>

        <p>For a more thorough introduction to retro play I recommend reading <a href="https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html">Principa Apocrypha</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="header-anchor" id="anchor-alignment"><a href="#anchor-alignment">Alignment</a></h3>

        <p>This oft-maligned mechanic will most certainly be in use. Don't consider it a limit on how your character can act.  Instead think of Alignment as a very broad guide to your character's world view.</p>
        
        <p>Alignment is expressed along two axis. The first axis is Law and Chaos. The second Good and Evil. The player chooses one from each axis to describe their character.</p>

        <h4>Lawful, Neutral, Chaotic</h4>

        <p>This axis describes how reliable a personality your character is.</p>
        
        <p>A Lawful character isn't necessarily concerned with local laws&mdash;though they may be. Instead Lawful characters are those that live by a personal code or by oaths sworn to some greater entity. This code tends to make the character predicatable.</p>

        <p>Conversely Chaotic types tend to live their lives on whims. They don't take oaths or at the least don't take them seriously. They are unpredictable and therefore unreliable.</p>

        <p>Neutral types fall somewhere in-between often living their lives by a loose set of guidelines. Where a Lawful character may never steal and a Chaotic character may steal according to whim a Neutral character may never steal unless of course they can get away with it.</p>

        <h4>Good, Neutral, Evil</h4>

        <p>This axis describes how much your character considers others.</p>

        <p>Good characters tend to consider how their actions will impact others where Evil characters only ever consider themselves. Neutral characters again fall somewhere in-between.</p>

        <p>If for example a Good, Evil and Neutral character all learned of a magic sword in a cursed tomb they'd all act differently. The Good character might opt not to go to the tomb for fear of unleashing the undead hordes rumored to sleep there. The Evil character would of course recover the sword and immediately vacate the area leaving the locals to deal with the undead. The Neutral character may on the other hand reason that the sword does no good locked in a tomb but also stay in the local area to fight the unleashed undead.</p>

        <h4>A Note on Good and Evil</h4>

        <p>Being Good doesn't mean your character is a push-over. Being Evil doesn't mean your character is always foul-tempered.</p>

        <p>Since this game will focus on mercenaries the alignments of the characters will tend toward Evil. This should not be taken as an excuse to grief the other players, create a high-confilct character, constantly de-rail the game or otherwise act in an anti-social way that harms the fun of your fellow players.</p>

        <h3 class="header-anchor" id="anchor-combat"><a href="#anchor-combat">Combat</a></h3>

        <p>We'll learn the details of AD&D combat through play but there are a few key points to be aware of.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of each round players announce what their characters will do and one initative roll is made for each side. High roll goes first.</p>
        
        <p>Rounds are a minute long. Instead of planning Move, Action Bonus action as you have in the past ask, "What can my character do in a minute?"</p>

        <p>Surprise is powerful. In the best case your characters may get two full attack routines before your enemies can act. That means that a character with a bow in hand and a rate of fire of 2 would be able to shoot 4 arrows before the enemies can act.</p>

        <p>If you're looking for a more detailed explanation see <a href="https://www.sage-jim.com/blog/add-combat-but-mostly-initiative/">AD&D COMBAT, BUT MOSTLY INITIATIVE</a> </p>

        <h3 class="header-anchor" id="anchor-resources"><a href="#anchor-resources">Resources</a></h3>

        <p>Though I plan to use the orginal AD&D books they are antiques and either difficult to come by or expensive. Following are some alternate resources.</p>

        <h2 class="header-anchor" id="anchor-game-primer"><a href="#anchor-game-primer">Game Primer</a></h2>

        <p>The style of game we'll be playing is called a "Hex Crawl". Hex Crawl games are all about exploration. In the beginning most (though not all) of the map will be unknown. As you travel you'll discover not only the terrain but also what resides there.</p>

        <h3 class="header-anchor" id="anchor-travel"><a href="#anchor-travel">Travel</a></h3>

        <p>Travel in a hex crawl is measured in hexes per day. It's assumed that the characters will spend eight hours a day travelling which accounts for about six hours of dedicated travel and two hours broken up over the day for breaks or getting one's bearings. It's important to remember here that we as players will be looking at an obvious game board but the characters are people standing on the ground without a map.</p>

        <p>The travel paces described in the table above assume the travellers are moving at a pace that could be sustained for long periods of travel. Think walking from New York to Boston. This pace allows travellers time for the rest necessary to recover spells and for natural healing to occur.</p>

        <h3 class="header-anchor" id="anchor-forced-march"><a href="#anchor-forced-march">Forced March</a></h3>
        
        <p>For various reasons travellers may wish to spend more time per day travelling. This is known as a "Forced March."</p>

        <p>When a Forced March is undertaken it costs more time to travel a similar distance since the individual or mount is being pushed beyond sustainable limits. Marching more than 8 hours in a single day causes enough stress to prevent natural healing from occuring. Marching more than 10 hours in a single day prevents spells from being recovered. These effects persist until a full day of rest is taken per consecutive day of Forced March.</p>
        
        <p>After 3 days of forced marching exhaustion begins to set in. Each player will make a Constitution check by rolling a number of d6 equal to the number of consecutive days of Forced March. Individuals who roll a number higher than their Constitution score are simply unable to go on without at least one day of rest.</p>

        <table>
            <caption>Travel: Additional Hours Per Hex Travelled</caption>

                <tr>

        </table>

        <p>In the event that marching must resume before the full rest period has passed the characters will resume at the difference between consecutive days of Forced Marching and consecutive days of rest. For example if the party completes a 4 day Forced March and then rests for 2 days before resuming they'll be considered to have marched for 2 days (4 - 2 = 2).</p>

        <h3 class="header-anchor" id="anchor-survival"><a href="#anchor-survival">Survival</a></h3>
        
        <p>A great general once said, "an army marches on it's stomach," and your characters are no different. To survive you'll need to find provisions during your journey. Foraging, pilfering or even earning though an honest days labor are just some of the ways to fill your stomachs. But going without for too long has severe consequences.</p>

        <p>For every day after the first your character goes without water your Constitution is reduced by 4 points. This reduction reduces Constitution modifiers and may result in a loss of maximim hit points. When your Constitution reaches 0 you die of dehydration. This condition can be removed fully with 1 day of rest and plenty of water.</p>

        <p>For every after the fourth your character goes without food your Constitution is reduced by 3 points. As above Constitution modifiers are reduced and penalties may incur. When your Constitution reaches 0 you die of starvation. This condition can be removed fully with 1 day of rest and plenty of food and water.</p>

        <h3 class="header-anchor" id="anchor-maps-and-navigation"><a href="#anchor-maps-and-navigation">Maps and Navigation</a></h3>

        <p>Maps in the game world are rare and expensive things that are works of art rather than highly accurate represantations of area. They are commissioned by the wealthy and focus more highly on paying tribute the patron than on mechanical accuracy. Moreover the cartographers of the game world don't have any sort of aerial photography, satellite imagery or digital surveying tools at their disposal. Maps are therefore created based on the cartographers knowledge of the area and the stories they've heard of the world beyond.</p>

        <p>Without highly accurate maps most people travel between places by following roads named for the places they go to. If an individual wanted to travel from Therund to Ware they'd simply travel Ware Road. When in Ware the same road is called Therund Way. To travel to farther places the individual simply travels from place to place in order.</p>

        <p>Most villages and cities are within a day's travel of each other.</p>

        <p>A core AD&D party (Fighter, Thief, Magic-User and Cleric) will be provided. Their rank will be augmented by additional Pre-Generated Fighters and Thieves according to party size. Stat blocks will be revealed privately.</p>

        <p>The provided characters are statistically complete but otherwise unformed. What they need to be unique and interesting is your imagination. To that end I strongly encourage each player to consider the following 5 questions, answer them in a conventient format and share them with the DM but <em>NOT</em> with the other players.

        <p><span class="bold">Why did you join the Iron Ring?</span> When joining the Iron Ring one's crimes and debts are forgiven at least by many kingdoms in the South. Are you fleeing a crime? Have you left a life on the farm behind?</p>

        <p><span class="bold">What is your real name? What is your Iron Ring name?</span> Iron Ring members are given nicknames by their peers and are known to each other by those names only. Be careful what you choose as a nickname. Your peers may change it at any time. Never reveal your true name.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">What's your greatest vice?</span> You're a brigand. Of course you enjoy vices. This will not have a negative game effect.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">What's your biggest fear?</span> Everyone has an irrational fear. This will not have a negative game effect.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">What will you fight for?</span> Even brigands have a sense of honor.</p>

        <h2 class="header-anchor" id="anchor-barony-of-therund"><a href="#anchor-barony-of-therund">Setting: The Barony of Therund</a></h2>

        <h3 class="header-anchor" id="anchor-barony-of-therund-faiths"><a href="#anchor-barony-of-therund-faiths">Faiths</a></h3>

        <p>While there are many faiths the world over there are two significant faiths in the Barony of Therund. The Pantheon and The Old Faith. Given that The Pantheon is a conquering faith the two are intrinsically in conflict. These days however that conflict is mostly rhetorical. </p>

        <h4>The Pantheon</h4>

        <p>Therund was at one time the southern most of the nothern baronies of the old empire. As such it was more thickly colonized than the baronies to the north. The pilgrims brought their religion along with them and here more than other places that religion supplanted the old faith of the native inhabitants</p>

        <p>This is the faith of Vizzir Valdon.</p>

        <h5>Incomplete List of Deities</h5>

        <h6>Kronos</h6>

        <p>King of the Gods and God of Time Weights and Measures</p>

        <h6>Helios</h6>

        <p>God of the Sun and Sky, Guardian of Oaths</p>

        <h6>Astraeus</h6>

        <p>God of the Stars, Planets and Divination, Father of the Four Winds</p>

        <h6>Oceanus</h6>

        <p>God of Rivers, Lakes and Oceans, Font of all of the earth's fresh-water</p>
        
        <h6>Metis</h6>

        <p>Goddess of good counsel, planning, cunning and wisdom.</p>

        <h4>The Old Faith</h4>

        <p>Long before humans lived in the North the fae called it home. Their beliefs are not so much a religion as outsiders would understand it but rather a knowing of the way of things and a respect for that way. The rituals, observances and sacrifices of that way maintain peace and balance among the fae.</p>

        <p>When the first humans moved into the area they learned these ways and they became mixed with their own ancestor worship. Over time this became known as the "The Old Faith", "The True Faith" or "The Old Ways".</p>

        <h3 class="header-anchor" id="anchor-intelligence-report"><a href="#anchor-intelligence-report">Iron Ring Intelligence Report</a></h3>

        <p>Following is the intelligence made available to the contingent of Iron Ring soldiers who travelled North with Chairman Vhennyk to establish a utopia in the Nentir Vale far from the corrupting influence of the decadent Southern city-states. Intelligence on Harkenwald and Nentir Vale omitted since it has no bearing on this game.</p>

        <p>Vhennyk's spies were not given much time before his cadre travelled North. The intelligence gained is sparse. Local siutaions may be more nuanced or have shifted in the 6 months since the report was distributed.</p>

        <h4 class="header-anchor" id="anchor-surrounding-lands"><a href="#anchor-surrounding-lands">Surrounding Lands</a></h4>
        
        <h5>Northern Lands</h5>

        <p>The Barony of Harkenwald and the settlements of the Nentir Vale lie North of Therund. Though allied by treaty the people of Therund see their Northern neighbors at best as hapless rube's and at worst filthy barbarians.</p>

        <p>With the persisent threat of invasion from the Trollhaunts the people of Therund will be reluctant to send their knights and soldiers North to aid their allies. Baroness Wade is therefore likely to be delayed in honoring her treaties. If Harkenwald can be taken quickly the Iron Ring may never need to defend itself from Therund.</p>

        <h5>Eastern Lands</h5>

        <p>The foothills east of Therund are home to The Hobgoblins. Chairman Vhennyk paid them handsomely to secure the Iron Ring's journey North. But this was meant to be a one-way trip. Rumors of Vhennyk's defeat have surely flown faster than the remaining Iron Ring soldiers. Flight east of Therund will no doubt result in torture and death.</p>

        <h5>Western Lands</h5>

        <p>West of Therund lies the dangerous wilderness known as the Trollhaunts. The terrain is a maze of swampland, thickets, gullies, and forested ridges sparsley dotted by ancient ruins and thick with Trolls. Any foolish enough to travel here should get their affairs in order and be prepared to die horribly at the hands of those foul creatures.</p>

        <h4 class="header-anchor" id="anchor-the-nobility"><a href="#anchor-the-nobility">The Noblility</a></h4>
        
        <h5>Baroness Magette Wade</h5>

        <p>Baroness Wade taxes little, maintains her knights, her borders, and her stores. While those stores are not abundant they are more than enough to see Therund through a difficult time. For these reasons the people have a generally positive opinion of their Baron.</p>

        <p>There are however grumblings among citizens who remember the old Baron fondly and are not happy with Baroness Wade's choice to take here mother's name. Still quieter rumors circulate in the circles close to the Baroness that she has taken her champion Adowa Sisay as a lover leaving the future lineage in question.</p>

        <p>Baroness Wade's younger Brother Eddard Perenon is seen by some as a more stable alternative. He has been away in the south securing trade vital to Therund's continued prosperity. This seems a smart political move on the part of the Baroness.</p>

        <h5>Sir Eddard Perenon</h5>

        <p>The second child of the old Baron Sir Eddard has a wanderlust unbecoming someone of his station. His elder sister has sent him away ostensibly to secure trade.</p>

        <h5>Sir Adowa Sisay</h5>

        <p>Sir Adowa Sisay is the Baron's champion, Baronial weapon master and widely considered the best swordsman (or swordswoman) in Therund. She's known to seek out young women to groom for the knighthood.</p>

        <h5>Djimon the Wise</h5>

        <p>The court wizard has served the Perenon family since his apprenticeship with the prior court wizard in the time of the current Baron's grandfather. Djimon is most likely comparable to Nimozaran (of Fallcrest) in power but he should be considered far more dangerous since he's certain to take the field with Baron Wade.</p>

        <p>At this time Djimon has no apprentices and no maid or servant of the keep no matter how trusted has been in his tower for years. From a distance we can tell that he often spends late nights in arcane research. Djimon's secretive nature and hidden research make him worth further observation.</p>

        <h4 class="header-anchor" id="anchor-settlements-and-their-disposition"><a href="#anchor-settlements-and-their-disposition">Settlements and their disposition</a></h4>

        <h5>Abandoned Keep</h5>
        
        <p>This keep has been unoccupied for several decades and may make a good temporary hideout. Though not currently occupied its suitability as a lair makes it attractive. Its existence is somewhat well known.</p>

        <h5>Athol</h5>
        
        <p>Athol is a distant mining town defended by Sir George West and a small mounted militia. Athol's isolation makes it difficult to reinforce and therefore the target of raids by local goblin tribes. Justice here tends to be swift and brutal.</p>

        <p>Iron Ring members should be able to come and go without much trouble. Any visiting here are strongly cautioned against even casual trouble due to the liberal application of frontier justice.</p>
        
        <p>Much of the ore mined here is sent North to Wilton to be ferried downstream to the smiths in Therund so there's a frequent need for capable caravan guards. The pay is lower than typical but the route is short. Entry into Wilton may be eased by arriving with a shipment of ore.</p>

        <p>The people of Athol have a somewhat negative view of the Baron due to their belief that not enough has been done to keep them safe. The Baron could curry favor among the people here by replacing their wooden paliside with a stone wall and decreasing their isolation from the rest of the Barony.</p>

        <h5>Belcher</h5>

        <p>Belcher is a small agricultural community defended by Sir Leonora Flinders. Sir Leonora was recruited and trained by Sir Adowa but in recent years has worked closely with Sir Oliver of Moonstair defending the border forests from troll incursions. She once frequented Therund but her visits have diminished and her position in court has become more formal.</p>

        <h5>North Fort</h5>

        <p>The Keep near the border that separates Therund and Harkenwald. North Fort's castellan is the elderly knight Sir Titus Fogg. Patrols here are well maintained but the discpline among the garrison is somewhat lax possibly due to the long peace in the area. North Fort would be simple enough to infiltrate with spies but a full assault would be dangerous given the proximity of reinforcements and the experience of the castellan.</p>

        <p>This is the most likely mustering place in the event that Baroness Wade decides to send her army North.</p>

        <p>Sir Titus likes the current Baron well enough but grumbles behind closed doors about her deviation from tradition.</p>

        <h5>South Fort</h5>

        <p>Ruins in the area of South Fort provide shelter for brigands, goblinoids and worse. Sir Adam Rackley takes an active role in South Fort's defense by leading frequent patrols and has been known to hire adventurers for dangerous tasks. So far this has been enough to prevent any organized resistance to the forces of Therund.</p>
        
        <p>In the event Baron Wade decides to move North Sir Adam and his soldiers will certainly join. South Fort will be left in the hands of its castellan Erasmus Welby. Erasmus is a seasoned veteran. Left with a reduced defense he'll likely take a pragmatic approach to defending the southern border thus increasing South Fort's reliance on adventurers.</p>

        <h5>Gill</h5>

        <p>Gill is a small agricultural community that also has a thriving furniture making industry supplied by timber floated down river from Ware. Gill is defended by Sir Ewdin Simpson. Sir Edwin works closely with Sir Oliver of Moonstair and Sir Leonora of Belcher defending the border forests.</p>

        <h5>Jaffrey</h5>

        <p>Jaffrey is a sleepy agricultural community defended by Sir Godfrey Towle. Sir Godfrey is an attentive defender of his community but slow to act.</p>

        <p>Old Buckey often mentioned a girl he had in Jaffrey. Perhaps she'd lend help to friends of his.</p>

        <h5>Lempster</h5>

        <p>Lempster is a small agricultural community that seems to attract danger from the surrounding forest.</p>
        
        <p>Sir Roderick Decker makes his home here. Decker's discpline and forthright honesty is without question among his peers. But his untempered honesty has won him no favor at court where he's openly voiced his disdain for Baron Wade's decisions to flout tradition by taking her mother's name. Since then his relations with the Baron have become frosty. He's therefore assigned lowly tasks that frequently take him away from Lempster.</p>

        <p>Sir Roderick is trusted if not precisely liked among the people of Lempster. If he's in residence it would be wise for the Iron Ring to avoid the place. If he's not home we should enter with caution. Frequent threats from the forest create opportunities to find favor among the people.</p>

        <h5>Moonstair</h5>

        <p>Moonstair is named for the ancient stone gate that lies at its heart. It's said the Moongate opened into the Never Never when the elves still called this place home. Once heavily guarded for fear of a faerie army pouring forth guarding the gate is now an honorific position. The knight of Moonstair deals with very real threats from the Troll Haunts.</p>
        
        <p>Sir Oliver Ashwell has for many years protected Moonstair, the surrounding area and indeed the entire Barony from invasion from the Troll Haunts. He's lead several successful raids against the trolls across the river and thwarted Chief Skaal's  repeated attempts of to organize them. He's been joined recently by his eldest son Stuart. Sir Oliver's deeds are well known throughout Therund. He's known among his peers as the most experienced Knight.</p>

        <p>Sir Oliver is typically found leading patrols, training his soldiers and maintaining his fortifications. His dilligence is matched by that of his wife Lady Hannah whose taken responsibility for the civic affairs of Moonstair.</p>

        <p>Should Baron Wade make a move North Sir Oliver won't be called upon since his presence in Moonstair is vital to the security of Therund. The Ashwell family seems to be above gossip so we should assume they're loyal to Baron Wade. However Sir Oliver maintains the second largest contingent of professional soldiers in Therund, partners with the Knights of Belcher and Gill and has actively sought the knighthood for examplary soldiers. His deeds have elevated him to folk-hero status across the Barony. We'd recommend developing spies in Therund to undermine Baron Wade's confidence in Sir Oliver.</p>

        <h5>North Milford</h5>

        <p>North Milford is a small agricultural community that also harvests lumber. North Milford lacks the capacity to send it down stream so lumber gathered here is used locally. North Milford is home to master cartwrights, wainwrights and even makes servicable bows and fine crossbows.</p>

        <p>Sir Elias Makepiece is the knight in residence but unlike his peers Sir Elias seems to have no inclination toward fighting or horsemanship or adminstration. What Sir Elias lacks as a knight he more than makes up for as an engineer. He's the architect behind most of the public works of the last two Barons and manufactures impressive siege engines.</p>

        <p>North Milford is led by a council of elders. North Milford receives frequent patrols from Therund.</p>

        <h5>South Milford</h5>

        <p>South Milford is a small community made up primary of ranchers, herders, horse breeders and horse trainers. Therund has the Baronial stables of course but the breeding of horses for all manner of tasks takes and the training of the finest war horses happens in South Milford. Sir Osmund Ramsey calls this place home and it will come as no surprise that he's known as the finest horseman among his peers.</p>

        <p>Sir Osmond's soldiers are well equipped and trained regularly. Frequent patrols from Therund and regular visits from knights in need or want of new horse keeps South Milford busling with military.</p>

        <p>South Milford has therefore enjoyed long periods of peace and safety. Sir Osmond is restless and would eagerly join the Baron on a campaign anywhere. The remaining garrsion hasn't had their mettle tested in combat and would likely by slow to respond to trouble.</p>

        <h5>Therund</h5>

        <p>Therund is the only true city in the Barony. Home to all the industry and vice one would expect of a capitol.</p>
        
        <p>The Baronial family and their retinue call Broadborough Keep home. The homes of most citizens are of stout timber. The Old City is surrounded by well maintained and patrolled stone walls. Therund has grown beyond the Old City. The roads leading into the outer or "New City" are well guarded but the city itself is porous. Therund could move all citizens into the Old City in the event of an attack.</p>

        <p>Day to day management of the keep and soldiers is left to the Knight Castellan Sir Aster Boru Addis. Sir Aster is a strict disciplinarian who seems to have no warm relationships whatsoever. Soldiers are alert and overzealous in her presence for fear of a public dressing down but often lackadaisical in her absence. There are a few officious tyes among the soldiers. These are best steered clear of.</p>

        <p>We recommend cultivating spies here to keep close watch on Baron Wade. The New City is easy eough to establish oneself in as long one has some useful trade. Infiltrating the noble class will take time and money.</p>

        <h5>Ware</h5>

        <p>Ware is a small logging village that does not have a knight in residence. The local militia is strong and organized and patrols from Therund pass through regularly. People here are suspicious of outsiders who stay longer than a day or draw a lot of attention.</p>

        <p>Baron Wade has kept the taxes low and the supply of Iron steady making the people of Ware happy and prosperous. It's best to keep a low profile here.</p>

        <h5>Wilton</h5>

        <p>Another small mining town Wilton is defended by Sir Lewis Alvey. Wilton can be reinforced within a day from North Fort lending it security and making a stable family oriented community.</p>

        <p>Sir Lewis is young and chafes for glory like Sir Oliver and action like Sir George. He'll be the first knight to charge into battle perhaps leaving Wilton poorly defended in his zeal for personal glory.</p>

        <h3 class="header-anchor" id="anchor-addendum"><a href="#anchor-addendum">Addendum: Other Facts</a></h3>

        <p>At this time only 4 wizards are known to the Iron Ring, in the North at least. Nimozaran the Green, Djimon the Wise, Oliver Hufflepuff and the as yet unnamed Wizard in your group. Wizards are rare.</p>

        <p>Holy men and women are all over the place but few have their prayers rewarded daily with spells.</p>

        <p>The typical soldier of Therund is equipped with Ring Mail, a shield, a spear and a short sword.</p>
        
        <p>Soldiers on guard duty in the various keeps may carry heavy crossbows during duty but those are returned to the armory when they are off duty. Outside of keeps they may be outfitted with short bows as heavy crossbows are considered too valuable to defense.</p>
        
        <p>If a soldier is part of a policing action they are equipped with Ring Mail, cudgel and whistle since stabbing one's own citizens is considered bad.</p>
        
        <p>Soldiers in more active regions may have used their loot to equip themselves with better weapons and armor.</p>

        <p>Knights in Therund equip themselves according to their personal style and wealth. They should be expected to have at least one mount, be wearing plate and be capable with sword, lance and bow.</p>

        <p>Knights are typically found in the company of one or more soldiers.</p>
