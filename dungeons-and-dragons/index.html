          I quite liked &ldquo;Chapter 1: A World of your Own&rdquo; from the 5E Dungeon Master's Guide. I found myself
          particularly influenced by the "Gods of your World" section due to my dislike of the samey feel of standard
          D&D pantheons, or as I've heard them called, (the source escapes me) micro-monotheisms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Gods of The Empire, which is as of now still unnamed, are in the parlance of the 5E Dungeons Master's
          Guide a "tight pantheon." For various reasons they are based on the Greek Titans but may of course evolve over
          time.

          My first instinct while I was writing the last was to create games that allow me to both play test rules and
          develop parts of the setting through running games. This development is not merely geographic but also
          temporal. I think giving the players the chance to learn about the setting through time and space will give
          them cross campaign insights. For my part it gives me the opportunity to find the place and time in which
          they'll have the most fun.
        </p>
        <h2>Capitol: a City in Need of a Name</h2>
        <p>
          My earliest game 5E with the members of my current group took place in my home brew Nentir Vale setting.
          Nentir Vale is from 4E and much of the customization I made and shared poorly was a reaction to &ldquo;Humans
          in Funny Hats&rdquo; combined with the &ldquo;Gods of Your World&rdquo; section of the 5E Dungeon Master's
          Guide. Adventures on the frontier of a fallen empire are simple enough since they can be for the most part
          standard D&D adventures. It begs the question, &ldquo;Why did the Empire fall and what was it like?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          The answers could be explored in the form of a lore document but I don't expect my players to be invested
          enough to read that sort of document. I believe it's far more rewarding for both myself and the players to
          learn about the Capitol through play. That means city adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am, for certain, intimidated by the idea of running a city adventure but, it could also be a lot of fun. To
          pull it off though I need a lot of advice. After some searching I've narrowed my basic resources to two to
          prevent analysis paralysis; &ldquo;Cities of Mystery&rdquo; and &ldquo;Blades in the Dark&rdquo;.
          &ldquo;Cities of Mystery&rdquo; because it's a great city building resource and &ldquo;Blades in the
          Dark&rdquo; because D&D a city based game needs non-combat systems to resolve, suspense and so forth. Oh, did
          I forget to mention I plan for this to be a "thieves" campaign?
        </p>
        <h3>Planning Capitol: a City that Still Needs a Name</h3>
        <p>
          I glanced over a lot of wonderful advice from
          <a href="https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/48182/roleplaying-games/running-the-city">The Alexandrian</a>
          that I'll probably return to but I'm often an impatient sort so I sketched out my own plan.
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Map the City</li>
          <li>Map the Neighborhoods</li>
          <li>Insert Important Landmarks, city buildings, religious buildings, monuments.</li>
          <li>Map the starting Neighborhood in detail.</li>
          <li>Actually write some adventures because that's the part the players actually care about.</li>
          <li>Name the City, don't forget to name the city.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          That's basically it. I'll of course need to produce a brief setting guide since certain classes won't work in
          a thieving campaign. The players should also know what to expect in a game so they can create characters
          they'll enjoy playing throughout.
        </p>
        <h3>Adventures in Capitol: a Joke that's Getting Old</h3>
        <p>
          D&D is a great framework for general fantasy adventures but when one wants to run more specialized games
          additional rules are needed to reward a specialized style of play. Combat is the primary stressor for players
          but in a city with guards and punitive laws avoiding it would be the better course of action. So we need some
          a framework to for stealth based adventure design and a system for rewarding players for stealth and planning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately some very talented people have solved this problem in the past. Let us therefore mine
          &ldquo;Blades in the Dark&rdquo; for that which we can use in D&D.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Progress Clocks</li>

            Downtime + 5E
            <ol>
              <li>Laying Low - Reduces Heat but also Reputation</li>
            </ol>

          <li>
            Gather Information - There's a system to remove player actin but I want RP here
            <ul>
              <li>
                Perhaps have each player invent a contact at character creation. A fence, a talkative barman &hellip;
              </li>

          <li>Need Reputation Mechanic</li>
          <li>Factions + Mausritter (maybe)</li>
          <li>Crew - But I want to make this an ongoing conversation among the players</li>

            <h1>Thoughts About My Next Game</h1>

          I&lsquo;ve been working in fits and starts to prepare good old &ldquo;T1-4 The Temple of Elemental Evil&rdquo;
          for my next game. I reasoned a while back that preparing a game in the "World of Greyhawk" would be both
          rewarding and less difficult than writing my own game. And yet I can't shake the nagging feeling that I should
          be working on my own setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The why of it is pretty simple. As much as I love the D&D of my youth I find the settings a bit bland.
          It&lsquo;s the old &ldquo;Humans in Funny Hats&rdquo; canard. If Elfs and Dwarfs and so forth don't have a
          unique perspective on the world or meaningful cultural distinctions from humans then they are no different
          from humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I quite think the point applies elsewhere. Should all Clerics have power over the undead? Do all gods have
          Paladins? Do Clerics and Paladins make sense in a fantasy world missing the Christian context these classes
          seem to belong to? Should every race worship the same way? Should fantasy religions be divided by race or by
          geography as real world mythology?
        </p>
        <p>I, of course, wouldn&lsquo;t be asking these questions if I was happy with the way things are.</p>
        <p>
          On the other hand I do want to get back to running games. Doing so in a world of my own invention would be far
          more difficult than preparing a module. Sadly my heart just isn't in it, module preparation that is.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the right thing to do is explore some ideas that might hold my interest and build around that regardless of
          effort.
