            <h1>Thoughts About My Next Game</h1>

          <p>
            I&lsquo;ve been working in fits and starts to prepare good old
            &ldquo;T1-4 The Temple of Elemental Evil&rdquo; for my next game. I
            reasoned a while back that preparing a game in the "World of
            Greyhawk" would be both rewarding and less difficult than writing my
            own game. And yet I can't shake the nagging feeling that I should be
            working on my own setting.
          </p>
          <p>
            The why of it is pretty simple. As much as I love the D&D of my
            youth I find the settings a bit bland. It&lsquo;s the old
            &ldquo;Humans in Funny Hats&rdquo; canard. If Elfs and Dwarfs and so
            forth don't have a unique perspective on the world or meaningful
            cultural distinctions from humans then they are no different from
            humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            And I quite think the point applies elsewhere. Should all Clerics
            have power over the undead? Do all gods have Paladins? Do Clerics
            and Paladins make sense in a fantasy world missing the Christian
            context these classes seem to belong to? Should every race worship
            the same way? Should fantasy religions be divided by race or by
            geography as real world mythology?
          </p>
          <p>
            I, of course, wouldn&lsquo;t be asking these questions if I was
            happy with the way things are.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand I do want to get back to running games. Doing so
            in a world of my own invention would be far more difficult than
            preparing a module. Sadly my heart just isn't in it, module
            preparation that is.
          </p>
          <p>
            So the right thing to do is explore some ideas that might hold my
            interest and build around that regardless of effort.
