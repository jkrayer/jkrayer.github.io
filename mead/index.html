        <p>
          While taking stock of my glass today, I decided to measure the specific gravity of
          <a href="/mead/batches/batch-007/">Batch 7</a> to see if I could remove it from the refrigerator. The specific
          gravity was stable and the smell was good, so I removed a taste and that was good as wellâ€”no lingering yeast
          or boozy flavors.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since that's the case, and because I had read "<a
            href="https://homebrewersassociation.org/beyond-beer/hydromel-how-to-make-session-strength-mead/"
            >Hydromel: How to Make Session-strength Mead</a
          >" earlier in the day, I'm wondering if my original tasting schedule is too conservative.
        </p>

        <p>
          My revised plan is therefore to rack <a href="/mead/batches/batch-007/">Batch 7</a> and allow it to come to
          room temperature. I'll then watch it to see if fermentation restarts. If it does not, I'll bottle and
          reconsider tasting. If it does, then I'll monitor and re-plan when fermentation completes.
        </p>

        <p>
          On a final note, it seems a shame to bottle in 32 oz containers since I may not want to consume 32 oz merely
          for tasting. I'll need to find smaller bottles for this purpose.

          Spent last night and this morning racking batches <a href="/mead/batches/batch-007/">7</a>, 8 and
          <a href="/mead/batches/batch-004/">4</a>. Also counted days in primary which are 19, 20 and 12 respectively.
          I've come to realize that I need some system for batching and aging that allows me to manage my glass so I'm
          not infinitely growing that collection. My vague plan is 1-2 weeks in primary, 2-4 weeks in secondary and then
          bottle age from there. This will need to be tested based on what' actually happening in the carboys.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far my experiments have been traditional meads with different honeys which has been fun but I'd like to try
          something new. To that end I've decided to following some more successful Mead makers recipes and to try
          making a Cyser. The variety wil make tasting more interesting and hopefully lead to learning about Mead faster
          than just repeating the same process.
        </p>
        <p>
          With fall approaching my <a href="https://neshanicvalleybeekeepers.com">Neshanic Valley</a> honey supply will
          be unavailable (after October) until Spring. Since that's the case I'm trying to use up what I have on hand a
          re-supply before the end of October. To this end I've purchased a 2 gallon glass "carboy" which I'll use to
          make Batch #9 a traditional Buckwheat Blossom mead from "The Complete Guide to Making Mead". Also trying to
          deplete my supply of Alfalfa Blossom honey and Cranberry Blossom honey in batches
          <a href="/mead/batches/batch-007/">7</a> and 8 respectively.

          After cold-crashing
          <a href="/mead/batches/batch-003/">Batch #3</a> I've done a lot of research about halting fermentation. The
          common wisdom seems to be that cold-crashing is the best way to create bottle-bombs<sup
            ><a href="#anchor-researching-stabilization-one">1</a></sup
          >
          and I certainly don't have enough refrigerator space to store increasing amounts of mead in the fridge. Since
          that's the case I need a solution for storing Mead at room temperature. And to make my life difficult I prefer
          not to fortify in order to keep alcohol levels sane and I prefer not to use sulfites.
        </p>
        <p>
          This leaves pasteurization. So when my new shipment of sanitizer comes
          <span class="strike">will sanitize and pasteurize <a href="/mead/batches/batch-004/">Batch #4</a></span
          >. I could not get more of this honey and don't wish to mix honeys (yet) for back sweetening so I'm going to
          let <a href="/mead/batches/batch-004/">Batch #4</a> go dry and see what happens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to earlier suppositions about the rate of experimentation
          <a href="/mead/batches/batch-005/">Batch #5</a> is hot on its heals. I racked off the primary yesterday and
          I'm already seeing more yeast fall to the bottom so it
          <span class="strike">seems I'll need to pasteurization this batch too</span> without gathering any data from
          <a href="/mead/batches/batch-004/">Batch #4</a>. On second thought I've got more of this honey so perhaps I'll
          back-sweeten with what's left and see what happens.
        </p>
        <p>
          It makes sense, therefore, to delay beginning Batch #6
          <span class="strike">until I've succeeded or failed with pasteurizing these two batches</span>. Here I'll have
          to adjust my process once again. I'll target a starting gravity of 1.115 in order to yield 15% alcohol at
          1.000 final gravity, the pasteurize and back back-sweeten. Batch #6 may actually turn out to be my first
          attempt at pasteurization.
        </p>
        <p>
          From here I could make Batch #6 the final round in
          <a href="/mead/batches/#anchor-expermentation-matrix-one">Matrix 1</a>
          since I feel I'll have effectively perfected my process. But I would like to stick with
          <a href="/mead/batches/#anchor-expermentation-matrix-one">Matrix 1</a>
          for 2-3 more batches. I think I've yet to use Butterbean and Orange Blossom. This is true but they're not
          available. I purchased Cranberry Blossom and Alfalfa Blossom instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="/mead/batches/#anchor-expermentation-matrix-two">Matrix 2</a>
          will be a lower ABV Mead perhaps Hydromel or Standard strength. I'm hoping for some Meads that I don't need to
          age as long so I can enjoy them sooner. I was able to purchase 5 lbs of Alfalfa Blossom honey so I'm wondering
          if I can get a semi-sweet hydromel strength and sack strength Mead out of that amount.

          Bottled and drank <a href="/mead/batches/batch-003/">Batch #3</a> last night. It was Mead but still yeasty and
          cloudy. I, therefore, feel it's best to age future batches a minimum of three months.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this in mind I need to plan around bottle aging or aging in the carboy. Bottle aging frees up carboys but
          could result in differences in flavor in the same batch over time. For my level of production this is probably
          not a meaningful concern.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally I've worked through about half of the locally available honeys.</p>
        <p>
          Given my plan to age for a minimum of 3 months and my progression through locally available honeys I think it
          make sense to slow
          <a href="/mead/batches/#anchor-expermentation-matrix-one">Matrix 1</a>
          down to monthly. This should give me plenty of time to get each batch stable in the carboy before bottling and
          a new mead to try one each month.
        </p>
        <p>
          Batches <a href="/mead/batches/batch-004/">#4</a> and
          <a href="/mead/batches/batch-005/">#5</a>
          were started within a fortnight of each other. I'll simply age these a minimum of three months and have two
          batches close to one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was also reading about de-gassing immediately prior to starting
          <a href="/mead/batches/batch-005/">Batch #5</a>. I saw recommendations to stop after 3 days. I've been
          observing a rapid drop in CO<sub>2</sub>
          during the first weeks while bubbling continues to to happen every second. So a reductions from 7 to 3 days
          may be in order.

          I was able to obtain 4 pounds of both buckwheat and blueberry honey from
          <a href="https://neshanicvalleybeekeepers.com">Neshanic Valley</a> Beekeepers. Was also looking for an
          additional 1 pound of bamboo blossom honey to back-sweeten <a href="/mead/batches/batch-004/">Batch #4</a> but
          it won't be available until next week.
        </p>
        <p>
          Considering aging future
          <a href="#anchor-expermentation-matrix-one">Matrix 1</a> batches for a minimum 3 months before tasting. If I'd
          like the blueberry honey mead batch available for Thanksgiving and I start it Thursday July 24 that would give
          me about 17 weeks or nearly 4 months of aging.
        </p>
        <p>
          This would put me off strict adherence to
          <a href="#anchor-expermentation-matrix-one">Matrix 1</a> which is not big deal but I'll either need to bottle

        <p>
          Earlier this year (2025) I promised myself to say "yes" to any crazy idea that popped into my head and then
          pursue that idea to completion. My first foray into Mead making was not great&mdash;my own fault&mdash;but the
          spirit of my promise had been achieved and I could have left Mead making there.
        </p>

        <p>
          My first 2 batches left me with a question that I've often asked elsewhere in my life. "How does one improve a
          skill?"
        </p>

        <p>
          Consider that in learning to make Mead as in other areas of life I have books and goals but not direct
          mentors, or in this case, natural talent. I've met people with sophisticated palettes and know for certain I'm
          not among them.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am, however, having fun and feel I can devise a procedure to learn this skill which, I hope, will be
          applicable to future endeavors.
        </p>

        <p>
          To this end I've devised an experimentation matrix to allow me to learn what flavors different honeys and
          yeasts produce. The goal is to limit variability along two axes (yeast and honey) and produce different test
          batches that will both help me refine my process and learn&mdash;to the best of my limited ability&mdash;what
          flavors I can produce.

        <p>
          If money, space and equipment were of no concern odd weeks would be for honey experiments and even weeks yeast
          experiments. I'd start a new one gallon batch every week with odd weeks using different honey with the same
          yeast and even weeks same honey different yeast.
        </p>

        <p>
          In reality these resources are all limited. Local honeys may be obtained in 5-10 varieties but testing the
          sheer number of yeast strains would be prohibitively expensive.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally this is a fairly aggressive experimentation pace if one also wants to age their Mead for any
          significant period. Considering I'm targeting sack strength Meads (an arbitrary target to be sure) it seems
          aging should take place for anywhere between 3 and 24 months.
        </p>

        <p>
          This would no doubt lead to a lot of 1 gallon jugs aging in the basement which while fun would not be an
          efficient use of equipment. Admittedly 1 gallon jugs are not prohibitively expensive but at some point moving
          on to fermenting larger quantities of Mead would be more practical.
        </p>

        <p>
          The plan therefore is to proceed with a new batch every other week experimenting with honey while keeping
          yeast the same. The experiments will be bottle aged and consumed at intervals of bottle date, 3 months and 6
          months. This supposes I'll consistently produce 1 gallon batches.
        </p>

        <p>This plan will of course be revised along the way.</p>
