        <p>
          Earlier this year (2025) I promised myself to say "yes" to any crazy
          idea that popped into my head and then pursue that idea to completion.
          My first foray into Mead making was not great&mdash;my own
          fault&mdash;but the spirit of my promise had been achieved and I could
          have left Mead making there.
        </p>

        <p>
          My first 2 batches left me with a question that I've often asked
          elsewhere in my life. "How does one improve a skill?"
        </p>

        <p>
          Consider that in learning to make Mead as in other areas of life I
          have books and goals but not direct mentors, or in this case, natural
          talent. I've met people with sophisticated palettes and know for
          certain I'm not among them.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am, however, having fun and feel I can devise a procedure to learn
          this skill which, I hope, will be applicable to future endeavors.
        </p>

        <p>
          To this end I've devised an experimentation matrix to allow me to
          learn what flavors different honeys and yeasts produce. The goal is to
          limit variability along two axes (yeast and honey) and produce
          different test batches that will both help me refine my process and
          learn&mdash;to the best of my limited ability&mdash;what flavors I can
          produce.
        </p>

        <p>
          If money, space and equipment were of no concern odd weeks would be
          for honey experiments and even weeks yeast experiments. I'd start a
          new one gallon batch every week with odd weeks using different honey
          with the same yeast and even weeks same honey different yeast.
        </p>

        <p>
          In reality these resources are all limited. Local honeys may be
          obtained in 5-10 varieties but testing the sheer number of yeast
          strains would be prohibitively expensive.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally this is a fairly aggressive experimentation pace if one
          also wants to age their Mead for any significant period. Considering
          I'm targeting sack strength Meads (an arbitrary target to be sure) it
          seems aging should take place for anywhere between 3 and 24 months.
        </p>

        <p>
          This would no doubt lead to a lot of 1 gallon jugs aging in the
          basement which while fun would not be an efficient use of equipment.
          Admittedly 1 gallon jugs are not prohibitively expensive but at some
          point moving on to fermenting larger quantities of Mead would be more
          practical.
        </p>

        <p>
          The plan therefore is to proceed with a new batch every other week
          experimenting with honey while keeping yeast the same. The experiments
          will be bottle aged and consumed at intervals of bottle date, 3 months
          and 6 months. This supposes I'll consistently produce 1 gallon
          batches.
        </p>

        <p>This plan will of course be revised along the way.</p>
