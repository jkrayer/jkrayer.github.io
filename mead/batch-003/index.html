          Previous to this batch I made two batches using the
          <a href="https://jiggerndash.com/products/deluxe-mead-making-kit"
            >Blue Ox Deluxe Mead Making Kit</a
          >
          and honey from Costco. Mistakes were made, first among them the honey.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since then I've read
          <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Guide-Making-Mead-Updated-ebook/dp/B0DJH9PJLV?ref_=ast_author_dp"
            >"The Complete Guide to Making Mead" by Steve Platz</a
          >. Using the information in this book I can now set a goal in terms of
          alcohol by volume and sweetness.
        </p>

        <p>A sack strength semi-sweet mead.</p>

        <h3>Assumptions</h3>

        <p>
          I expect yeast will die at or minimally above its alcohol tolerance.
          Based on that assumption I've set my target starting and ending
          gravity readings to produce a 15% semi-sweet mead.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>100 oz Poland Spring Water</li>
          <li>3 pounds Neshanic Valley Dutch Clover Honey</li>
          <li>5 grams Lalvin ICV D47 Yeast</li>

        <h3>Observations</h3>

        <p>
          Mixed must in a pitcher with a spoon instead of shaking 1 gallon
          carboy. This went very well. A bigger pitcher would reduce spillage.
        </p>

        <p>
          Only need about 100 oz of water to rehydrate yeast and make the must.
        </p>

        <p>Clover honey was a massive improvement over Costco honey.</p>

        <p>Must color is far darker also due to the honey.</p>

        <p>
          A lot of up front CO<sub>2</sub> led to early explosions. Degass more
          carefully in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          Did not adjust gravity readings for temperature but considering the
          adjustments are by thousandths I think the impact is negligible as
          long as the temperature is stable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cold-crashing and racking seems to have worked bust also resulted in a
          lot of waste. For future batches I plan to back-sweeten as many times
          as necessary for the yeast to die of natural causes and for the
          desired final gravity to be reached.
        </p>

        <p>
          Loss as 1 gallon feels tragic. I'll stick with 1 gallon batches for
          experimentation but definitely want to move on to 3 or 5 gallon
          batches.
        </p>

        <h4>Day of Bottling</h4>

        <p>
          Pale yellow, cloudy, dry yeasty flavor but doesn't leave the mouth
          feeling dry.
        </p>

        <p>This leads me to believe "green" Mead should be aged.</p>
