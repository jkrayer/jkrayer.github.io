        <p>A hydromel strength semi-sweet mead.</p>

        <h3>Assumptions</h3>

        <p>
          Based on previous experience I plan to start this batch at a starting gravity of 1.050 which should yield a
          6.5% ABV Mead. I'll pasteurize the must at 1.000 then back-sweeten to 1.020.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>108 oz Poland Spring Water</li>
          <li>
            2 pounds Neshanic Valley Alfalfa Blossom Honey
            <ul>
              <li>1.5 pounds for primary fermentation</li>
              <li>0.5 pounds for back-sweetening</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>5 grams Lalvin ICV D47 Yeast</li>
          <li>Go Ferm Rehydration nutrient</li>
          <li>Fermaid O yeast nutrient</li>
        </ul>

                think is a sign that I need to add some tannins. Nutty after taste like a pilsner.

        <h3>Observations</h3>

        <p>
          This batch has a "yeasty" odor that I find unpleasant and could have one of several causes, including too much
          yeast, excessive yeast nutrient added, yeast still in suspension due to pasteurization.
        </p>

        <p>
          I learned from the "Man Made Mead" youtube channel that fermentation requires only about 1 gram of yeast per
          gallon of must. This in not exact since more sugar requires more yeast. Given this is a hydromel strength Mead
          1 gram of yeast is likely sufficient.
        </p>

        <p>
          What I'm smelling in the Mead may be yeast but it may also be unconsumed nutrients. It may be that I overfed
          the yeast which might not have required a lot of nutrient addition due to the lower sugar content of this must
          as compared with previous batches.
        </p>

        <p>
          It may also be that pasteurization has left some yeast in suspension. The must is certainly cloudy which I
          believe (at this time) is due yeast in suspension.
        </p>

        <p>
          Considering I still have about 3 pounds of Alfalfa Blossom honey I'd like to design a new batch that attempts
          to correct all of the above issues. This new batch would use 1 gram of yeast, 1 addition of Fermaid O and
          perhaps I would halt the fermentation with cold crashing. Not as positive about the last point since
          <a href="../batch-003/">Batch #3</a> is also yeasty. I'm also wondering as I write this whether the amount of
          Go Ferm in the initial rehydration is part of the issue. If so I could also try a batch without nutrients. I'm
          not confident in my scale's ability to measure small amounts accurately so this could be a better alternative
          considering the tools currently at my disposal.
        </p>

        <h4>Tasting</h4>

        <p>
          <time datetime="2025-09-18">September 18, 2025</time>: Tasting #1 - Still smelled unpleasantly yeasty. Kevin
          observed this as well. Given his diminished sense of smell I decided to bin this batch.
