          It feels a bit antiquated to start a website by typing HTML in the current year on the current day. There are
          after all many wonderful content management systems, blog platforms and static site generators available. Each
          of these could solve the problem of publishing content to the web far more elegantly. And yet &hellip; each of
          these comes with a cost in time.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I love learning I find it far more difficult to compel myself to write. But write I must, because
          writing is the solution to another far more interesting problem. That problem is repeating myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          My life is filled with notebooks and mark down files and ideas on scraps of paper and comments on code I've
          forgotten I've written and a heck of a lot of circling back to interests interrupted by other interests. I
          have questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          How do I come back to those interests and pick up where I left off? How do I measure when I've explored a
          topic deeply enough and remind myself not to circle back again? Can I store the notes in an easy to reference
          non-linear way? Can I create a site where each subdomain or each page can be fully custom?
        </p>
        <p>
          So why build a website in the most archaic way possible in the current day and age? It's simply the
          <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">M.V.P.</abbr> for answering my own questions.

          In <a href="/blog/scope-functions-and-closures/">Scope, Functions and Closures</a> we learned that JavaScript
          has first class functions and saw examples of functions that both took functions as arguments and
          returned functions. As with so many things there's a term for functions that can either take a function as an argument or return a function. Such functions are
          called <em>Higher Order Functions</em>.

          It's not my intention to repeat the excellent explanations of others on the subjects of scope, functions and
          closures (some linked below). Instead this is meant to be a quick code focused reference for the occasions in
          which I find myself able to share what I've learned with others.
