          It feels a bit antiquated to start a website by typing HTML in the
          current year on the current day. There are after all many wonderful
          content management systems, blog platforms and static site generators
          available. Each of these could solve the problem of publishing content
          to the web far more elegantly. And yet &hellip; each of these comes
          with a cost in time spent learning the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I love learning I find it far more difficult to compel myself to
          write. But write I must, because writing is the solution to another
          far more interesting problem. That problem is repeating myself.
        </p>

          My life is filled with notebooks and mark down files and ideas on
          scraps of paper and comments on code I've forgotten I've written and a
          heck of a lot of circling back to interests interrupted by other
          interests. I have questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          How do I come back to those interests and pick up where I left off?
          How do I measure when I've explored a topic deeply enough and remind
          myself not to circle back again? Can I store the notes in an easy to
          reference non-linear way? Can I create a site where each subdomain or
          each page can be fully custom?
        </p>
        <p>
          So why build a website in the most archaic way possible in the current
          day and age? It's simply the
          <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">M.V.P.</abbr> for answering my
          own questions.
