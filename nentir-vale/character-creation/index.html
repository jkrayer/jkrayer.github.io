      <p>This article gives guidance for creating characters that are native to the Nentir Vale setting. If this guidance does not allow for an interesting characters concept you may create a character from some un-explored region of the world who has come to The Vale.</p>
<h2>Races Native to the Nentir Vale</h2>
<p>No half-* races. The powers that be do not allow it.</p>
<p>Drow are not a playable race. This is not Greyhawk, there is no underdark.</p>
<h3>Dwarf</h3>
<p>Inspiration: Basic/AD&amp;D</p>
<p>The Dwarves of the vale are mainly from Hammerfast, a dwarven kingdom on the eastern edge of the vale at the edge of the Dawnforge Mountains. A Few are from the scattered Glintshield clan who once protected Stonefang Pass to the west.</p>
<p>Dwarven Legends suggest that the world was forged by the Dwarven Gods as a reward for their ancestors service in the Dawn War. A primeval war between order and chaos.</p>
<p>Dwarven society is highly structured. Dwarves tend to commit early in life to a single pursuit and dedicate their lives to its mastery. Dwarves tend toward classes that involve discipline and training.</p>
<p>To create a dawrf for the vale choose the Mountain Dwarf sub-race from the PHB.</p>
<h3>Elf</h3>
<p>Inspiration: LotR/Dresden Files</p>
<p>The Elves of the Vale come from the Harken Forest in the southern portion of the vale. Among the fey it is know as the Harken Court. The Harken Court is ultimately answerable to the Summer Court.</p>
<p>Elves are the scions of a powerful race of primordial fey that claim to predate the Gods. They have have an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animism">animistic</a> faith. Druids are their priests.</p>
<p>Elven society is based on a system of quid pro quo. Alliances bewteen powers shift rapidly.</p>
<p>To create an elf for the vale choose the Wood Elf sub-race from the PHB.</p>
<h3>Nen</h3>
<p>Inspiration: Vikings/GoT North Men</p>
<p>The Nens are the original human inhabitante of the Nentir Vale. They live in small settlements in the northern part of the vale like Nenlast and Winterhaven. Many more continue to live a nomadic lives farther to the north.</p>
<p>The Nens hold a mixed faith believing in both the old ways (the Elven faith) and the Gods(the Nerthan faith).</p>
<p>The Nens are ruled over by ancestral Thanes and live in family and clan groups.</p>
<p>You may use the variant human rule to create a Nen. Nens tend toward the classes which require less discipline and training.</p>
<h3>Nerthan</h3>
<p>The Nerthans who remain in the vale are the last stubborn decendants of the once sprawling Nerathan Empire. Most remaining Nerathans live in the city of Fallcrest.</p>
<p>The Nerathans believe in the gods considering the &quot;Old Religion&quot; of other humans as a dead faith for a bygone age.</p>
<p>Fallcrest is ruled by the last remaining noble line from Nerath, The Lord Warden Faren Markelhay.</p>
<p>You may use the variant human rule to create a Nerathan. Fallcrest is the only Human settlement with a large enough infrastructure to train Paladins and Wizards.</p>
<h2>Races Who Frequent the Vale</h2>
<p>These races may not call the Nentir Vale their home but most pass through frequently enough to make them at home here.</p>
<h3>Dragonborn</h3>
<p>Dragonborn legend tells of an ancient homeland called Arkhosia that was lost during a great war between its King and Queen. Since then they've been without a homeland. Dragonborn have survived through the ages by serving as mercenary armies.</p>
<p>Dragonborn follow a dualistic religion with the Gods Bahamut and Takhisis representing opposing forces. Bahamut is charity while Takhisis is avarice, Bahamut represents light and Takhisis dark and so on.</p>
<p>Dragonborn live in small, rigid militaristic clans and are one of the few races made up almost entirely of player character classes.</p>
<p>As products of their society Dragonborn tend toward classes that require rigid training and discipline.</p>
<h3>Halflling</h3>
<p>If Halflings have a homeland they're not telling and few outsiders have ever seen them gathered in groups larger than 2 or 3.</p>
<p>Halflings blend the faiths of the cultures they've visited into a broad kind of spirituality that frustrates the zealous.</p>
<p>Halflings are unrepentant travellers and story tellers. They're often found travelling with trade groups and performing or gambling during layovers.</p>
<p>Halflings tend toward the classes that allow them to avoid direct conflict with the big folk.</p>
<h3>Orc</h3>
<p>Orcs in this region hail from the Stonemarch Mountains in the North West part of the vale. A group of any size is cause for alarm in the Vale but individuals and small group are able to visit human settlements relatively unharassed.</p>
<p>The Stonemarch is a hard land that breeds hard Orcs and Orcish life is generally short and brutal. Orcs form small to large tribal groups led by the strongest warrior.</p>
<p>To create an Orc use the Half-Orc race from the PHB. Orcs tend toward any path that bestows fast power. They are most often barbarians, warlocks and fighters.</p>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<h3>Barbarian</h3>
<p>Common among the Elves, Nens and Orcs the latter tending most toward the Path of the Berserker. The only deviation from the PHB being that a totem is considered a religious commitment to the path of a single animal.</p>
<h3>Bard</h3>
<p>Most cultures save possibly the Orcs have bards among them. Valor bards are most common among the Nens and Dwarves.</p>
<h3>Cleric</h3>
<p>All the cultures with established faiths have Clerics who can find a god able to grant them access to whichever domain the player may choose. What is unique to the setting is that Gods only come in Good and Neutral flavors. The servants of Malign entities are known as Warlocks.</p>
<h3>Druid</h3>
<p>The priests of the old faith. Druids are most common among Elves and Nens.</p>
<h3>Fighter</h3>
<p>The Harken Elves are the only remaining culure sophisticated and magical enough to train Eldritch Knights. Champion and Battlemaster fighters are common among all the races.</p>
<h3>Monk</h3>
<p>No relgious order native to the Vale is sophisticated enough to construct Monestaries and train Monks.</p>
<h3>Paladin</h3>
<p>Oath of the Ancient Paladins are nearly unique to the Elves and Nens. Devotion and Vengance Paladins are represented among the cultures that worship the gods.</p>
<h3>Ranger</h3>
<p>Rangers are represented in all cultures but are most common among the Nens, Orcs and Elves.</p>
<h3>Rogue</h3>
<p>Rogues are represented in all cultures but only The Harken Elves remain sophisticated and magical enough to train Arcane Archers.</p>
<h3>Sorcerer</h3>
<p>Sorcers are rare. Draconic bloodline Sorcerers are most common among the Dragonborn.</p>
<h3>Warlock</h3>
<p>Though Orcs are most commonly Warlocks any race with a soul to sell can have members among their ranks. The exception here being a pact with the Archfey. Many followers of the old relgion find themselves in the service of powerful being from the never never.</p>
<h3>Wizard</h3>
<p>Anyone with the inclination to spend long hours in study can become a wizard. The only established Wizard in the Vale is in Fallcrest.</p>
